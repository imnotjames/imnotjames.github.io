For some reason, any time you see someone in a movie go into space
without a space suit you invariably see them explode, freeze, or
somehow boil.  None of this is true, but it's not like the vacuum
of space is really all that hospitable.

There's a neat [blog post from 2013][1] that backs me up on this, but
for the most part: going out in to space without a space suit
is inadvisable, just for different reasons.  There's the issue of
radiation, vacuum, and a distinct lack of oxygen.

Within a few seconds, you'd feel slightly warm, not cold, in space.
Sure, space is cold but there's very little transfer of temperature.
This is because there's no matter in space to transfer heat via conduction
or convection.  Instead, all you've got is thermal radiation.
This means either heat will be being radiating to you slowly from
the sun or heat will be radiating off of you slowly.  You won't
become a popsicle.

The vacuum of space is dangerous, but not in the same way that you
where people pop like a balloon.  Instead, you'll see some tissue
swelling from water vapor under the skin, with some pretty gnarly
bruises.  However, this can also end up causing gas bubbles to form
within the bloodstream which can be incredibly deadly.
Another issue is that the decompression will cause the air in
lungs to expand to an extent that could be incredibly dangerous.
So, Pro-Tip: Before taking a space walk without a space suit,
exhale as much as you can.

The vacuum of space means a lack of matter, though.  Oxygen
is matter.  Often times, humans need oxygen to survive.  This is
where we come into our third problem: you can't breathe in space,
and worse, because of the vacuum the lungs actually will REMOVE
oxygen from the blood stream.  In under 30 seconds, you will 
start getting deoxygenated blood to the brain, and it's lights
out.  Suffice it to say, it's downhill from there.

So, short version?  Don't go into space without a pressure suit
and a steady supply of oxygen.
