I read a wonderful [blog post][1] about the opening lines
of novels and their importance.  This is very true!  There's a lot
to be said of the impact you can have in that first sentence.
This applies not just to books - you have a miniscule amount
of time to leave a good impression and bring people in.

However, there's quite a bit also to be said about not starting
with that opening sentence.  You don't need to get it right
first thing.  A terrible book with an amazing initial line
is just a book that everyone will read and hate.

If you can iterate, you can eventually get that amazing sentence
that gets everyone to pick up what you're selling.

This, of course, applies beyond just script writing.  Software, products,
whatever it may be - often, the biggest roadblock you will have is
that initial impetus to get things rolling.  Once you have something
it's much easier to make smaller improvements.

With that in mind, go forth and embrace the crappy little elf that
builds the v0.1 of whatever you're making.  Then, show them
how much better you can make it.
