I read a really interesting [medium post by Piotr Migdal][1] about
procrastination.  In particular, it reframes the issue of procratination
from being a productivity problem into what else it could be: an
emotional management problem.

[Timothy Pychyl writes about this in Psychology Today][2]  summarizing a few
studies.  We're conditioned to not enjoy bad outcomes and often that is
exhibited by enacting our emotion-coping mechanisms -  fight, flight, or freeze.
Anxious about something?  Easy.  Just don't do it.  Procrastination and
[giving up a bit of self control is a form of mood repair][3].

There's a bit of truth in there and it's something good to introspect about.
Fight, flight, or freeze has been a part of our instinctual responses for a
long time.  It served us very well in the past and can today as well.  Flat out
rejecting this and fighting it as a time management issue may be burying other
problems and exacerbating it long term.  Some theories point at one cause of
[depression being another outlet of the freeze response][4] - a biological
defense mechanism to trauma perceived by our automatic nervous system.

Introspection on how you're feeling the next time you feel that need to get
away from it all (by cleaning or watching netflix) might be more effective than
tomato timers or to-do lists.
