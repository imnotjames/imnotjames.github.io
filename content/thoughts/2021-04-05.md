The Supreme Court has [come to a decision][1] on the Google v Oracle case
regarding Google's usage of the Java SE API in Android's Android Runtime,
as well as Dalvik VM before it. This has been ongoing since August 2010.

TLDR: It's fair use, the declaring code is very small and is not
implementation, but instead a general organization. As such, it's fair use.

Let's read a couple excerpts!

The most succinct description of how this is fair use:

> Google copied these lines not because of their creativity or beauty but
> because they would allow programmers to bring their skills to a new
> smartphone computing environment.

But does this mean that programs in general are not copyrightable?
The following decides that's not the case:

> As part of an interface, the copied lines are inherently
> bound together with uncopyrightable ideas (the overall organization of
> the API) and the creation of new creative expression (the code inde-
> pendently written by Google). Unlike many other computer programs,
> the value of the copied lines is in significant part derived from the in-
> vestment of users (here computer programmers) who have learned the
> APIâ€™s system. Given these differences, application of fair use here is
> unlikely to undermine the general copyright protection that Congress
> provided for computer programs

How much of the code is considered copied:

> If one considers the declaring code in isolation, the quan-
> titative amount of what Google copied was large. Google
> copied the declaring code for 37 packages of the Sun Java
> API, totaling approximately 11,500 lines of code. Those 
> lines of code amount to virtually all the declaring code
> needed to call up hundreds of different tasks. On the other
> hand, if one considers the entire set of software material in
> the Sun Java API, the quantitative amount copied was
> small. The total set of Sun Java API computer code, includ-
> ing implementing code, amounted to 2.86 million lines, of
> which the copied 11,500 lines were only 0.4 percent

However, my favorite part of the entire decision is that they retell one of
the world's shortest short stories:

> When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.
