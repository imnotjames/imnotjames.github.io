There are a lot of birds!  There's a recent [global abundance study of birds][1]
which puts the estimate of birds at around 50 billion individual birds
in the world.  This is across roughly 9700 different species!

From [big birds][1] to [little birds][3], they're all amazing.

I think the [Northern Mockingbird][4] is interesting in particular, though.
They're known to be highly intelligent.  If you are just a passerby in their
nesting area, they'll usually leave you alone.  However, they can recognize
individual humans!   If you're commonly near them they'll remember you and
have been known to try to scare you away.  They'll even remember if you've
[previously threatened or attacked them][5].
