Regional Dialects are something of an interesting topic for me.  It's not just
an indicator of your originating geography but also the cultural upbringing
you had.  Over the next few weeks I'll be picking out a few different
language dialects to both learn about and write about.

To start with, a dialect that's near and dear to me: [Appalachian English][],
also known as Smoky Mountain English or Southern Mountain English.  This is
the dialect that's most often attributed to the inland Southern United States
and has many features of 18th-century colonial English.  I'd often encounter
this dialect with my family in Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Viriginia.

Some of the words I've picked up over time that I can think of:

* `afeared` - to be afraid
* `buggy` - a shopping cart
* `britches` - pants
* `crick` - this may be either a stiffness of joints in the body or a creek
* `fixin` - this can also be a few things - either to say something is soon to
            happen, or a portion of food
* `holler` - the steep valley between two hills, because you can "holler"
  across to the other side
* `plumb` - completely
* `reckon` - suppose
* `skifting` - a dusting, usually of snow on the ground
* `sody-pop` - carbonated beverages
* `spell` - either a duration of time or the state of being lightheaded
* `yonder` - somewhere distant, away from where we are currently

Appalachian English has many other archaic phrases, words, and prefixes.  
Most of the above fall into that - either from older English words like
`breetches` or the `a-` (such as `afeared` or `a-haunted`) prefix which comes
from Early Middle English.  `right` can also be used with adjectives and
adverbs such as `right fine` or `right quick`.

Southern drawl is also an important aspect of this dialect.  Sourthern Drawl -
considered [different from the Southern twang][twang-vs-drawl] - is a common
pattern in how the vowels are prolonged making the speech sound slower.
To many, this leads to the incorrect assumption that
an individual with a drawl is [uneducated or dim-witted][drawl-uneducated].
Part of this is from a lack of exposure to Southern accents - people that
don't hear it can immediately hear the other-ness.  However, even people that
grow up with the accent are told that a Southern accent is "wrong" via
pop-culture and media.  How many celebrities speak with a Southern drawl?

Dialects like this might sound strange to people that aren't part of them.
However, to those that are within that dialect outsiders without it sound
foreign.  To quote my cousins in regards to my differing dialect,
"Yew talk real funny!  Y'all spake all fast-like.  Yer a yankee from up
yonder, aintcha?"
