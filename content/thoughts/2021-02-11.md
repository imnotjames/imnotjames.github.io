There's something about the fact that I'm taking an at-home class for cooking
from a world-renowned french cuisine Chef that's feeling like got an
uncomfortable "rich people things" vibe to it.

It makes me think about [a New Yorker article about the "Joylessness of Cooking"][1].
In theory, I love to cook.  It's a way of peering through time and culture to see
how different people live and have lived.

Those of us that still have stable incomes can often find far more ingredients
than ever before.  In New York City there's [Chef Collective][2] seeing even better
stock because many restaurants have shuttered or are generally seeing fewer
customers.  Some restaurants, like [Xi'an Famous Foods][3], have even pivoted to
selling "kits" instead of doing delivery because their foods don't work well
with delivery.

The article points out a book - [How to Cook a Wolf by MFK Fisher][4].  The book
through dealing with shortages and difficulties that existed when cooking during
World War 2.  I am so grateful that my life is in a place where the feeling
of hunger is a choice rather than a fact of life.  I picked up a copy of the
book.  I'm really looking forward to reading it.

In theory, I love to cook.  In practice, I've been cooking far too often to
truly enjoy it.  I have always had an extreme respect for my mother and father.
We cooked food at home every single day while I was growing up - sometimes
out of necessity.  We didn't do fast food, and we very rarely ate at
restaurants or had takeout.  They followed through with that to make sure
there was food on the table & dealt with getting children to eat that food.

I really do love cooking - just.. in theory.  In practice, I can't wait to
make it an exciting optional activity like this cooking class I'm taking.
I've registered to the wait list for the vaccine and boy am I looking forward
to that.
