How magical is that magic carpet ride, though?

We see prince Ali and Jasmine leave Agrabah on a magic carpet ride.
Jasmine asks if it's safe and then Aladdin just starts singing.
Off to a shakey start, but they leave Agrabah, climb 15,000 feet above
the clouds.  On a few occasions they are thrown off the carpet
but it catches them.  You know.  Safe.  60 seconds later they're at
what looks like the Great Sphinx of Giza.  15 seconds later they
are at what looks like the Parthenon in Athens.

The distance from the Sphinx in Giza to the Parthenon in Athens
is 615 miles across the Mediterranean Sea.  To travel this in 15
seconds that magic carpet ride would be traveling in excess of
150,000 miles per hour - or roughly Mach 195.  This puts them in
the same league as a faster than average meteor.  Meteors heat up
both from air friction as well as the compression of air in front
of them, and thus it would be safe to believe the magic carpet
ride would have burst into flames as it travels across the sea.

Assuming they decelerate over the course of 3 seconds (perhaps
when Aladdin is saying there's time to spare) they would have
experienced 2200 times the force of gravity.  If Aladdin is
around 120lbs normally (he's a street rat, after all), his body
would have felt like it weighed ~280,000lbs.  For reference,
a blue whale is 290,000lbs.

So, per Jasmine's question, "Is It Safe?", most certainly not.
If it weren't for the fact that it's "magic" I wouldn't trust
prince Ali with anyone's safety on that thing.
