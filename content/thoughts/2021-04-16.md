Someone called out allowing disposable email as a security concern today.

I disagree.  Disposable email is just another term for... email.  Any email
service that you can sign up to.  Just that some are easier to sign up to than
others.

These lighter-weight sign up email services are important for people that are
privacy conscious and want to control how they are interacted with more readily.

What about gmail?  Okay, I sign up once with example@gmail.com - then the next day
I sign up with e.xample@gmail.com - then e.x.a.mple@gmail.com - then example+1@gmail.com ...

"Disposable" email services are not the issue, here.  I don't care if you use
a service that is "disposable" or "real" or not.  I can use any address @my-domain
and it will all work.

Does that mean I run a disposable email service and I should be blocked?
