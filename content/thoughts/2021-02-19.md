The Perseverance rover confirmed a successful touchdown yesterday,
February 19th at ~3:55PM EST.  The mission is one of the most ambitious
we've sent to the red planet - but not just because of the rover
(which, itself, is the most complex and featured rover we've sent).

The EDL (Entry, Descent, and Landing) platform was also for more advanced
than any other we'd sent - with the descent into the Martian atmosphere
being yet another part of the experiment.  The ablative heat shielding
covered the bottom of the capsule - with a type of plating covering it
which upon heating would vaporize and be carried away from the
Perseverance capsule.

The Perseverance also carried 661lbs of tungsten weights.  However, just
because they're dead weight doesn't mean they won't serve a purpose.

Two 165 pound blocks of tungsten kept Perseverance in a stable and balanced
spin on its journey from Earth.  This prevented any one side of the capsule
from getting too hot.  These are jettisoned 900 miles or so above Mars as
they'd no longer be needed.  Waste not, though.  These two tungsten blocks
will slam into the surface of Mars at 9,000 mph or so and is
[part of a very vital experiment][thump-thump].  The InSight lander has a
seismometer and even at 2000 miles away it'll be listening for Perseverance
knocking with these tungsten payloads.

Removing those two tungsten blocks is an important part of the entry phase
because while balance is required during the journey, the entry requires
debalancing.  Because one side of the capsule is heavier than the other
the entry angle will be at 16Â°.  This leads to a slight amount of lift
experienced by the craft, allowing the descent to be controlled via
[RCS (Reaction Control System)][rcs] powered rotation - rotate left to
cause the lift to push you one way, right to push the other, and go left
and right consistently to burn off speed.  This is all autonomous!

There's also six 55lb tungsten masses that ensure landing is aligned.
These are jettisoned right before firing the parachute and are used to
ensure that the radar will be oriented in the correct direction.  While
the RCS was fired roughly 2,256 times during atmosphere entry, at this point
they aren't a whole lot of use.  These tungsten blocks are jettisoned two at
a time, and will cause the craft to roll into the exact orientation needed
for the rest of the descent.

Haven't heard yet if InSight heard Perseverance's hello to start a welcome
party, but all of this was fantastically interesting to me and I'm always 
surprised at how much NASA can achieve.

Wanna watch it?  [They streamed the landing on twitch!][twitch]
What an amazing future we live in.
