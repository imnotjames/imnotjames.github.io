[Fastly had a bit of an incident on June 8th][1] which you might've seen.
The outage lasted around one hour, but it meant that loads of sites that rely
on their CDN were impacted.

Fastly uses a fork of [Varnish 2][2] that they maintain internally - a general
HTTP Cache.  This is core to a lot of how they do business, but isn't the only
piece of software they employ.  However, they do give customers access to [VCL][3],
a domain specific programming language to influence the behavior of their caching
solution.

Best guess is that someone had included a configuration value that created VCL
with undefined behavior which caused the shared infrastructure to crash
or otherwise stop serving as expected.  This is all a guess, of course, because
they're being relatively hush-hush about the exact details of the problem.
(Makes sense because we don't really need to know & it's ~24 hours since
the actual problem.)

They did provide a very great blog post and short post-mortem about the
incident right away, though.  For such a large company, that's quite
impressive.

Let's just hope they don't have to do that too often.
