Disney World is a monumental effort to make it the Most Magical place on Earth.
Much of this is attributed to the extreme amounts of engineering that have
gone into manufacturing the magic.

I think the Utilidor is the best example of this.

Whenever you're at Disney World, you're technically on the rooftop of the
Magic Kingdom.  A portmanteau of Utility and Corridor, the Utilidor is the
true "first floor" of the theme park.  In most places in Florida, you dig a
few feet down?  You hit water.  Building underground is thus mostly a
dangerous and difficult proposition.  Thus, most of the Magic Kingdom is
about 100ft above sea level.

The Utilidor is used for logistics in the park.  Getting anything from point
A to point B magically can be done via the tunnel systems.

Employees (referred to as "Cast Members" per corporate mandate) travel between
locations using the Utilidor.  This allows them to navigate quickly using
electric vehicles & get in the correct locations quickly for their work.
The Utilidor also houses a number of services for employees - such as
cafeterias, banking services, hair salons, and more.

What I think is the most interesting, however, is the automated vacuum waste
collection within the Utilidor.  The utilidor has pneumatic tubes to quickly
whisk away any and all trash away from the park - to where it can be
disposed of or recycled.  This helps the custodial staff keep the park as
clean as it is - by taking all the trash and dumping it somewhere else.

There are "Backstage" tours of Walt Disney World that show off the utilidor
among other ways that the magic is preserved at the theme park.  Even if
some of the illusion can be dispelled, though, it's still real magic if you
believe in it.
