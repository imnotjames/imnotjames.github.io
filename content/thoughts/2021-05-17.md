Sometimes new technology and transit goes haywire, as seen [earlier this morning][1] when
a reboot caused turnstiles to lock up and prevent entry.  In most cases the turnstiles are
supposed to fail open.  However, it seems an oversight was made during the engineering process
which caused them to fail closed.

New technology isn't always terrible, though!  One thing MTA has been working on has been
improving the signals they use for maintaining traings.  Over the past five years the MTA
has been replacing the existing infrastructure with newer digitized versions.
Some of these signals were a century old.  Because of this, trains can safely increase speeds!

If you take the R line in the city, for instance, trains have sped up 15mph all the way
to 50MPH in some areas!  Even dangerous areas like near the Brooklyn-Bridge/City Hall station
they were able to increase speeds because of this.

Some of this has also allowed for new kinds of data to be recorded.  Many of these points help
with logistics and planning for maintenance work and train routes.  However, others
enable [things like the really cool live MTA map][3] that shows where trains are in
real time along the routes!
