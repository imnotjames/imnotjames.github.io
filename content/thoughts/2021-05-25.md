Getting DOOM to run on devices is a bit of a past-time to some folks.
[A recent product hunt offering has a DOOM captcha available][1].

DOOM can run on a [fridge][2], a [pregnancy test][3], or a [printer][4].
This is partially because DOOM was written run on Intel 8086 PCs with limited

power, it requires a miniscule amount of technical capabilities to
run - at least compared to software like modern web browsers.

Much of this has to do with how the internals of DOOM works!
If you'd like to learn more about that, there's always the 
[Game Engine Black Book on DOOM][5]!

Then you can figure out how to run [DOOM in DOOM][6].
