[A 2015 study][study-pdf] explored an interesting phenomenon: People that use
web search tools to find data conflate information they find online with their
own knowledge.  This lead to increased self-assessed knowledge and even in
unknown domains or areas of study - even when trying to answer something,
searching, and getting zero results.


Part of this is because learning, knowledge, and memory are closely related.
The process by which we shift memories from "short term" to "long term" memory is
referred to as consolidation.  This process is when we're most susceptible to
having our memories "rewritten" natrually, [as described by Daniella Schiller.][partial-recall]
It's possible that search engines have become ubiquitous in our lives
as a transactive memory partner - we receive information and then quickly
re-remember the information as being our own.

This isn't new to the internet, though.  Memory and knowledge is not
exact - mistaking outsourced knowledge for internal knowledge also
happens when part of integrated social environments.  In a [1995 study][hutchins-1995],
cockpit crews often conflated knowledge from another member as their own
knowledge once it had been communicated to them.

If you'd like to subject yourself similarily to the study & conflate internet information
with your own knowledge: Why are there jokers in a deck of cards?
