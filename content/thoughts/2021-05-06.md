A [paper submitted to ACM in 2019][1] reviewed the privacy implications of
accelerometer data as of that time.

Behavior tracking can go beyond the traditional step counter people think
of when it comes to behavioral analysis.  [Eating, drinking][2], and [smoking][3],
can be determined from wrist-mounted accelerometers.  Further, gait can be inferred
and [level of intoxication][4] can be interpreted.  This can also give a guess
on [how heavy of a load a person is carrying][5]. 

Taking all of this a bit further, you can even determine what is being said or
written via these devices.  Determining specifc [spoken "hotwords" could be done][6]
via accelerometer alone.  It's also possible to figure out what someone has typed
on their phone's virtual keyboard without actually having access to the keyboard
through [only the movements of the phone][7].

[Inference beyond this can be done][8] to get fuzzier understanding of who someone is
without actually know who they are.  Someone's physical activity and timing can
infer someone's socioeconomic status, openness, and extraversion.  It can be used
to understand someone's mood, their relationships with others, and overall stress
levels.  It can also be used to determine age and gender based on gait, movement
parameters, and activity.

The short version, though?  We really need to enforce the privacy related to
wearable devices.  It's an imperative for our safety.
