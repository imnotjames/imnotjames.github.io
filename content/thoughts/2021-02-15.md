In Javascript, [functions always have variadic arguments][1].  This leads to
some performance hits because there always has to be an adapter when
using a JIT compilation.  The adapter required creating a new frame
in-between the caller and callee frames. 
Creating a frame is super costly.

On the v8 development website a [new blog entry was posted][2] which details
how this process works and what they've done to dramatically improve 
function calls by optimizing this javascript feature.

How'd they solve it?  They work through the arguments array backwards
so they don't really need to know how many arguments are in the stack,
but they can assume that there's at least the enough arguments to
satisfy the parameter count - even if the arguments are `undefined`.
This allows for cutting up the formal parameters and the extra variadic
arguments to pass them to the callee frame in a way that doesn't require
extra lookups or an extra frame that will calculate it all.

No more overhead!  Super fast!
