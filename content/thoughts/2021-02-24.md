Having not gone to any conferences, conventions, or the like for a while
[a quora post caught my eye being shared in discord][1].

A ways back I'd have collected all the swag I could.  Heck, I only wore shirts
that were swag because they were free.  It was great because I wouldn't have
to pay for them and they were decently high quality! 

Now a days, I don't really want that stuff.  The last conference I went to I even
won a new computer monitor (thanks, I guess, Asus?) which I promptly gave
to a friend because I already have a monitor and didn't want to bring it back
on a train.

Getting swag can be exciting - except for when I have 10 venmo hoodies, 4 Wayfair
hoodies, 2 jackets that are branded elsewhere, and now more socks than I know what
to do with.  It's just not much of a marketing channel for me anymore.

I say that - but then came the time when I spoke with the Pokemon Company.
They give out nice shirts that were exclusive, high quality, and from a brand that
I have an affinity for.

So, exclusive, high quality, and engaging brands.  They don't really even
need to market to me, but do.  So why is it that [companies spend billions][2]
on low quality garbage to give out at conferences?  Do we need more
tiny and useless thumb drives, pop-sockets, or totes?  (They shouldn't.)

For companies giving out swag to employees there's now entire companies devoted
to creating these - like [SwagUp][3].  This is a little more interesting as
an employee but...

I'd rather just get snacks, experiences, or other things that I can
consume rather than more things that'll probably end up in a landfill.
