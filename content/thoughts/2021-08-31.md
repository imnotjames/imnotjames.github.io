Kanji is exceptionally confusing to me.  When looking at the word 森林浴 - "shinrin yoku",
I wanted to learn a bit more about these three words that make up the compound word.

To start with, though, let's look at another word: 木 - "ki", or in english "tree".
It's 4 strokes and is a grade 1 / JLPTN4.  It's taught in grade 1 of Japanese schools
and is part of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test N4.  This one's pretty simple!

So, then 林... 木木, right?  This is "hayashi", and could somewhat be translated to a
small grove or woods.  Think a bunch of bushes, a few trees on their own.  8 strokes,
still grade 1, but JLPTN3.

森 ... okay, so we have THREE 木 now.  This is "mori", translated to a small forest
or a large wooded area.  Imagine a denser greenery - perhaps harder to traverse.
12 strokes, again grade 1 and JLPTN3.

Put all this together and we have 森林 - "shinrin".  A big forest, like a mountain
covered in foliage.  If you're thinking a forest in English, that's what we've got here.
Lots of 木.

浴 is yoku.  10 strokes, Grade 4, and JLPTN2.  This one's a bit tougher.
It's a combination of 氵 (one of the water radicals) and 谷 ("tani", or valley).

Put it all together and you have 森林浴, a peaceful walk to bask in the forest.
