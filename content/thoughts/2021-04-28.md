For some reason, Pokemon cards - first edition - are going for insane prices.
Folks are spending [millions of dollars][1] on them.  Part of this
is because the sale of first edition cards like a Charizard have sold
for [over $200,000 USD][2].  People are investing in Pokemon cards
instead of property.

However, because of this, we're seeing an increase in fraudulent cards.
The most public of which is a [$375,000 USD box that ended up counterfeit][3].
This isn't a new trend - art forgery has been documented even two thousand
years ago - where Roman sculptors produced copies of Greek sculptures.
However, at the time, it was very likely known by the art buyers
of the time that these were not genuine pieces.

In 1496, [Michelangelo sculpted a work of art - a sleeping cupid][4].
Through acid washing techniques, the piece was artificially aged
and sold to a cardinal - who learned that it was not a true antique.
However, being so impressed by Michelangelo's talent, he let the young
artist keep the money he was paid.  It was still placed with other
true antiques, and was thus passed off as if it were one.

It leads me to think about Phillip K Dick's "The Man in the High Castle".
In it, we have Frank Frink who makes and ages Colt Pistols as well as
other memorabilia.  Does it matter more that they are actual Colt Pistols
from the civil war?  Or that people that are collecting them can say that
they are?  It's all in the "historicity".

How much does it matter if the Shiny Charizard in Mint 9 condition
is a forgery without true historicity if nobody could tell?
