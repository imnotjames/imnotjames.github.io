There's a really neat [stack overflow post][1] about the
[Amiga OS][2] Kickstart image.  They ask why the image included during the
bootstrapping sequence of the Amiga computers - known as "Kickstart" - was so
ugly.  The image showed up and instructed the user to insert the Kickstart
floppy so the computer could start.

The short version is that they were severely resource constrained.  A bitmap
payload would have been around 4KiB, but vector art data for the Kickstart
image weighed in at only 412 bytes.  This was very important when they only
had 8KiB of space to work with for the pre-boot ROM.

The vector art data is as follows:

```hex

```

The way it was interpreted followed pretty simple rules:

> 1. Read two bytes at a time.
> 2. If both bytes are `FF`, end the program.
> 3. If the first byte is `FF` and the second byte is not, start drawing a polyline with the color index given in the second byte. Treat any subsequent two bytes as `x,y` coordinates belonging to that polyline except if the first byte is `FF` (see rules 2 and 3) or `FE` (see rule 4), which is where you stop drawing the line.
> 4. If the first byte is `FE`, flood fill an area using the color index given in the second byte, starting from the point whose coordinates are given in the next two bytes.

[Sheryl Knowles][3], the first Amiga artist, noted that there were no real
tools on the Amiga to make many of these images aside from when they
eventually wrote [Graphicraft][4].  At that point, using graphicraft she
held the floppy in her left hand and painstakingly created the drawing with
her right hand.

Which is very true!  Even if it's ugly, it's clear what it's supposed to be.
It's not supposed to be high art - it's supposed to be an icon you see for a
couple seconds at most.
