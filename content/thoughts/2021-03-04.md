The Cephalopod - squid, octopus, nautilus, and cuttlefish - are both adorable
and incredibly intelligent.  Within the first hour of their life, they
[start foraging and camoflauging][1].

[Recent studies][2] have shown that they also possess the capacity for
exerting self control.  This is commonly known as the
[Stanford marshmallow experiment][3], a study on delayed gratification.

This does bring into question animal intelligence and conciousness.
Urbanization means people spend less time with other animals.  We interact
with a smaller variety of animals and thus can see much less varied expressions
of intelligence from them.

[Dr. David Scheel raised a Day Octopus in his home][4], documenting the
experience.  The Scheel family named her Heidi.  Heidi was able to show
recognition of faces, solved puzzles, and built relationships with members
of the Scheel family.  Of this, Scheel noted:

It could be that we aren't smart enough to judge how smart animals are.
The Octopus followed a different evolutionary path than we did.  As such, the
expressions of intelligence they have could just be poorly understood by us.
Just because we excel in a larger number of areas on average doesn't mean that
some animals can do better than some people in specific tasks.

Perhaps the entire marshmallow test is flawed.  It purports that cuttlefish
show intelligence normally seen in toddlers.  Maybe cuttlefish are just able to
show intelligence in one aspect that is similar to toddlers.  Or maybe
cuttlefish aren't that smart - [maybe babies are just stupid.][6]
