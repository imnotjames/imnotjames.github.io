A few studies published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
purport that [we have biases towards class from even a few seconds of speech][1].

This is concerning but not unheard of.  There's subjective standards in the English
language which people bias as being a perceived higher social class.  It changes
how we consider others.  Another followup study examines how this may affect
hiring managers' assessment of qualifications.

However, the research is even more interesting because it shows that pronounciation
cues in speech gives a more accurate assessment as to someone's social status
than the content.
