Google made a statement a few days ago that they're
[not building new ways to track individuals across the web for targeted ads][1].

The optimist in me wants to say that they heard the message from
consumers that it's not wanted, and that targeted ads just aren't
making the money that they used to.  People are wisening up
and don't click ads.  [Or people are intentionally sending bad data.][2]

The realist in me says they have something else, like [FLoC][3], that they've
shown works. Something even more privacy-invasive. Something that locks
competitors out. Something that is more predatory.

I'm sure I have nothing to worry about. Google won't be evil.
