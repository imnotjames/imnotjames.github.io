There's a [fantastic set of essays][1] by Cedric Chin about becoming a
data driven business.  It starts off on a really inspiring
[essay dissecting Goodhart's law][2].  Most of the essays are focused
around Amazon and often reference the book that Cedric had helped with:
["Working Backwards" by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr][3].

For those that don't know it, Goodhart's law is:

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Every measure is a proxy for what you actually want -- and is always an
imperfect proxy for it.  Even when you're using a tape measure you're not
quite getting what you want - an exact measurement of a distance.  Instead,
you're getting something that's "close enough" in precision to the real
deal that it works fine.

In [another article][4], Cedric summarizes a [paper by David Manheim and Scott Garrabrant][5]
that breaks down Goodhart's law into regressive, extremal, causal, and adversarial.
This is reflected in Donald Wheeler's take on Goodhart's law from [Understanding Variation][6]:

> When people are pressured to meet a target value there are three ways they can proceed:
>
> 1) They can work to improve the system
> 2) They can distort the system
> 3) Or they can distort the data

This is a fantastic way to frame Goodhart's law.  Instead of it being a problem this
can be solutions against.  You can make it difficult to distort the data or the system -
or you can make it easy to improve the system.

Wheeler notes that this can be seen between the Voice of the Customer - the expectations -
and the Voice of the Process - what can be done in the real world.  


If you give people flexibility to make various systems work for them and to drop measurements
that aren't useful then you
