There's a [fantastic set of essays][1] by Cedric Chin about becoming a
data driven business.  It starts off on a really inspiring
[essay dissecting Goodhart's law][2].  Most of the essays are focused
around Amazon and often reference the book that Cedric had helped with:
["Working Backwards" by Colin Bryar and Bill Carr][3].

For those that don't know it, Goodhart's law is:

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

Every measure is a proxy for what you actually want -- and is always an
imperfect proxy for it.  Even when you're using a tape measure you're not
quite getting what you want - an exact measurement of a distance.  Instead,
you're getting something that's "close enough" in precision to the real
deal that it works fine.

In [another article][4], Cedric summarized a [paper by David Manheim and Scott Garrabrant][5]
that breaks down Goodhart's law into four "flavors": regressive, extremal,
causal, and adversarial. This is reflected in Donald Wheeler's take on Goodhart's
law from [Understanding Variation][6]:

> When people are pressured to meet a target value there are three ways they can proceed:
>
> 1) They can work to improve the system
> 2) They can distort the system
> 3) Or they can distort the data

This is a fantastic way to frame Goodhart's law.  Instead of it being a
problem this can be solutions against.  You can make it difficult to distort
the data or the system - or you can make it easy to improve the system.

Wheeler notes that this can be seen between the Voice of the Customer - the
expectations - and the Voice of the Process - what can be done in the real world.
Focusing entirely on the Voice of the Customer without understanding the
Voice of the Process leads to gaming the measurements, inadvertently or not.

The article goes into depth on how Amazon has approached this problem - via their
Weekly Business Review.  It provides people flexibility to make the various systems
work for them and also to drop measurements that aren't useful.  It promotes
iteration and learning, synchronizing leadership rather than promoting
blindly following numbers.

At the same time, you can't run a business without these kinds of proxy measures.
Goodhart's law isn't wrong - but instead of approaching the problem by choosing
to avoid measuring, we instead need to find solutions to prevent it.

The problem isn't having targets - it's failing to reconcile those
targets with the real world.
