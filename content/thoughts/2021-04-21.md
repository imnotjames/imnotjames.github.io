[University of Minnesota published a paper about vulnerabilities][1] being
introduced to open source by malicious actors contributing commits.  They did
this by intentionally introducing bad code via merge requests to the Linux
kernel, leading to vulnerabilities.  Some of the 190 commits have
[even landed in stable branches][2].

Ethically, this is an
unacceptable behavior for experimentation, and has been reported to the UMN
Institutional Review Board on these cases.  Ethics complaints have also been
filed to IEEE to have the publication revoked, but it's unlikely that it will
be.  They've also been [banned, as a University, from contributing][3] to the
Linux kernel, as well as from communicating through many Linux kernel mailing
lists.

Their experiments prove that humans are fallible.  Good job, folks.
