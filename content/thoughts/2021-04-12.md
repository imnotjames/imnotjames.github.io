Yet another great step for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, there's now an
implementation of `std::unique_ptr` [backed by crytpo NFTs][1]!  Exciting.
What does that mean in practice?

The `std::unique_ptr` in C++ is a smart [pointer][2] that manages another
object via a pointer (a reference to a memory address).  What it does that
makes it "smart" is that it disposes of the object when the pointer goes out of
scope.  This is most often done using the `delete` operator, but can also be
supplied by the developer.

This NFT pointer implementation has the same semantics and usability of a
traditional smart pointer, but also is on the Ethereum blockchain, making it
superior.

> As we all know, adding blockchain to a problem automatically
> makes it simple, transparent, and cryptographically secure.

The difference in performance between the two is negligible
[in the grand scheme of things][3], with `std::unique_ptr` running in
0.005 seconds, followed quickly behind by `nft_ptr` at 3 minutes per call.

I applaud Zhuowei Zhang's efforts to bring crytocurrency to more widespread
appeal.  [For more information, check out their whitepaper][4].
