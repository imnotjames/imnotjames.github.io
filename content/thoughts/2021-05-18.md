SQLite is a self-contained, high-reliability, and very very fast SQL database engine.
It's known as the [most widely deployed database engine][1] in the world.  It's
absolutely the most deployed database engine [off-world, too][2].

There's a really cool blog post [about hosting SQLite online][3], with a virtual
file system that uses range requests to cut down on fetches.  In this way, you can
read from a database of nearly any size and query it efficiently!  With a properly
written query you can do instant lookups against gigabyte+ SQLite tables.

If you mix this with [trigram indexing][4] you can do a lot of Full-Text search needs
via an S3 bucket and the web!  While it won't have nearly as many features
this could potentially replace quite a lot of the features Algolia provides.

Would I suggest replacing a mission-critical log aggregation and query for
a top-100 tech company?  Nope.  Is it good enough [for smaller use-cases][5]?
You betcha it is.
