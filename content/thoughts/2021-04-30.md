Influenza has more or less disappeared, [according to Scientific American][1].
Where we'd normally be seeing 35,000+ deaths from the flu in the US?
We're now seeing only around 600 or so.  The WHO has also noted this as well 
in their vaccine recommendation, [and in their influenza tracking operations][2].

What's more is that because there's so few virus particles circulating
there's a lower chance for mutation.  This means the vaccine will be even
more effective than it would be.

Hopefully this doesn't mean we'll lose some immunity we'd normally have
from it and end up with an influenza strain that is much more difficult
to manage.
