John Wilander, principal engineer on Intelligent Tracking Prevneting in Safari,
[opened an issue on the WICG FLoC github][1] pointing out how FLoC can be used
to create cross-site tracking.  What this would mean is that the purported
privacy benefits of FLoC would be moot.  In fact, it would make it easier
to track a user.

Indeed, de-anonymizing users is a huge problem.
[99% of Americans can be identified by 15 demographic attributes][2].
As part of this research, they [created a tool][3] using just three
data points - ZIP code, gender, and birth date - which has an 83% chance
of identification.

We aren't as anonymous as we'd like to think because we're all wonderful and special
little snowflakes.
