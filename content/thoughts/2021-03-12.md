The [UK is in talks to depart from using GDPR][1].  This likely means
one of two outcomes - neither of which are positive.

Option A - come up with their own privacy laws.  This is iffy and is the path
the USA is currently on.  You end up with multiple laws that may by chance hit
similar beats but may conflict and make it more difficult to be compliant.  In
this world, many companies will just ignore the privacy laws in the hopes that
they won't be caught - or that the legal jurisdiction they're in makes it
difficult to litigate.

Option B - roll back everything.  This is bad for privacy, consumers, and
citizens of the UK but good for businesses.  As such, this is the likely path
forward, given other recent actions taken by parliament.

If we continue to split up privacy laws, I've got a bad feeling about the
future of the internet.  I could foresee a future where it's no longer open
across country borders and becomes insular within each jurisdiction, sharing
stamped out by bureaucracy.
