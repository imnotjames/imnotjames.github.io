The [playdate][1] is an amazingly interesting exercise in
the right marketing, the right UX, the right device, and the right time.

It's an amazingly whimsical but simple device with
a black and white screen, an itty bitty processor,
some buttons, a directional pad, and a crank.  Yes, a
crank on the side as part of the game input.

This was made with folks over at [Teenage Engineering][2],
who are also amazingly good at marketing & UX.  I've
had so much fun with the pocket operators ([here's a video someone else made, not me!][3])  and 
always want to buy their other devices..

None of these devices are exactly special from a technical sense but it
is from how it makes you feel.  I think that's what matters.
