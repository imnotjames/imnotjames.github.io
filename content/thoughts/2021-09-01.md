Jet Lag - as the name might imply - is relatively new for humans.  Propeller-driven craft or trains
often were much slower and didn't travel as far over between timezones to cause it.  Jet-driven airplanes
travel such great distances that our circadian rhythm is frequently disrupted - causing disorientation
and stress.

Traveling west is usually considered to be an easier shift than east.  This is because most humans circadian
clock has an endogenous period that's slightly greater than 24 hours, and it's easier to expand that window
than to shrink it.  In most cases, the 6-9 hour shift East causes the most problems.

There's lots of "cures" for jet lag but in most it boils down to timing and sleep schedules.
Push to go to bed at a reasonable bedtime in the target timezone.  Time your flight to avoid
light when leaving and find light on arrival.

Sometimes, though, you just have to wait for your soul to catch up with your body.
