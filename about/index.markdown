title: About Me
---

I'm not _the_ James, just a James.  Many people would suggest to go to
my [resume][resume] to learn who I am, but it's rather short and
uninteresting.

What's more interesting are logic problems, retro science fiction, video
games, comics, bad movies, and electronic music.  I contribute to the PHP
project in my free time, various other open source projects, and idle around
[##php on Freenode][##php] as well as a handful of other IRC channels.
I have a passion for web technologies, and am always looking to learn
something new.

You can contact me online via [email][email], on [AIM][aim], or fork me on
[github][github].
