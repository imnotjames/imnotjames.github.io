title: About Me
---

I'm not _the_ James, just a James.  Many people would suggest to go to
my [resume][resume] to learn who I am, but it's rather short and
uninteresting.

What's more interesting are logic problems, retro science fiction, bad movies,
video games, comics, ramen, and electronic music.  I contribute to various
open source projects, including the PHP project.  I idle around
##php on Freenode as well as a handful of other IRC channels helping people.

I have a passion for technology, and am always looking to learn something new.



You can contact me online via [email][email], [tweet at me][twitter], or fork me on [github][github].
