title: About Me

I'm not _the_ James, just a James.  Many people would suggest to go to
my [resume](/resume.html) to learn who I am, but it's rather short and
uninteresting.

What's more interesting are logic problems, retro science fiction, video
games, comics, and electronic music.

I'm currently employed as a PHP developer, but in my free time I like to
contribute to various open source projects.

You can contact me online via [email]({{ site.contact.email }}), on
[AIM]({{ site.contact.aim }}), or fork me on
[github]({{ site.contact.github }}).
