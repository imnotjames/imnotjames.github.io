I'm not _the_ James, just a James.  Many people would suggest to go to
my [resume](/about/resume) to learn who I am, but it's rather short and
uninteresting.

What's more interesting are logic problems, retro science fiction, video
games, comics, and electronic music.

I'm currently employed as a PHP developer, but in my free time I like to
contribute to various open source projects.

You can contact me online via [email](mailto:wnzrf@abgwnz.rf) and on
[AIM](aim:goim?screenname=reallynotjames), or fork me on
[github](http://github.com/imnotjames/).
