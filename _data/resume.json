			I get things done, ship amazing software, and create a superb user
			experience - all while hitting every specification and business
			requirement.  Unit tests and general test driven development are
			some of my go-to tools for crafting supreme code in a multitude of
			languages, and I've also dabbled in some end-to-end testing
			frameworks.


			This isn't just a day job to me, it's a passion.",

			building up the most fanastic systems you could ever imagine. The
			ally you have dreamed to have. Winning countless battles of wits
			against compilers and interpreters, accomplishing everything
			regulation compliance of an impeccable detail to hardened systems
			capable of withstanding even the most brutal of attacks. I ship
			amazing software, and code I work with becomes stable -
			just like magic. Some call it luck, a roll of the die. In my
			experience, there is no such thing as luck."

				Battle is not all in store, however.  In times of peace, the

				well.  To accept the silence of passing unit tests is to know
				true peace of mind. To code with hidden information is to
				protect against future attacks.  To master the use of XDebug is
				to open the mind's eye and see into the stack itself.

				These are the disciplines our hero teaches.",
