Everyone knows that PHP is a fractal of bad design.  It's a broken tool, a
double clawed hammer, and is generally confusing in many large ways.  Truly a
scourge on the craft.  Even with all of that it is one of the most used tools
for the web and gets more popular every day.

### PHP is not foremost a general purpose language

The biggest issue that people take up with PHP is that it doesn't match
up against their general purpose language of choice.  That is a completely
useless point to make because PHP is not a general purpose language.  It was
specifically created for the web, and that is what it does the best to this day.

Where every other language has a framework to take care of FastCGI, HTTP,
templating, in a way PHP has all of this to some existence in the core.

HTTP, including handling all of the different verbs and cookies is baked into
the language.  There are ways to access these as soon as you

As for templating, PHP is a templating system in itself.  It may be an ugly one
and there are more robust and clean templating out there but it can be used
in those ways.

### Everything in PHP is stolen

### Weak Typing can be nice

### Many problems people have with PHP are historical issues

Almost every single problem that I see that people have with dwindles down to
the fact that PHP is incredibly backwards compatible.  Backwards compatibility
has its price, though, and that brings in odd naming conventions,

There are many tools out there that I don't care for.  Design decisions can make
them clunky to use and makes them not perform their job very well.
PHP is a double clawed hammer, and it's just what the web needs sometimes.

Respect the double claw.
