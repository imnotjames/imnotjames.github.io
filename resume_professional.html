				In my free time I often find myself still programming - it's a passion, and not just a day job for me.
				I tinker and tool with everything I own, trying to push it to and past its limits.
				I'm fairly active in several IRC channels on the Freenode network to help others with questions on programming languages and other topics I'm familiar in.
