					Summary
				</h2>
			</header>
			<blockquote>
				I am an Engineer through and through - I solve practical problems.  I get things done,
				ship amazing software, and create a superb user experience - all while hitting every
				specification and business requirement.  Unit tests and general test driven
				development are some of my go-to tools for crafting supreme code in a multitude of
				languages, and I've also dabbled in some end-to-end testing frameworks.
				<br />
				<br />
				This isn't just a day job to me, it's a passion.
