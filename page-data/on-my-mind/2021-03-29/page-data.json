An empty shipping container is 4 tons.  A fully-loaded\ncontainer is 33.5 tons.  The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mil_Mi-26\">Mi-26</a> is the largest and most powerful\nhelicopter to go into serial production and it can only lift 14.5 tons.\nThis would be roughly 60-240 minutes per container to offload, assuming\nthe helicopters don’t have failures.  At a 20k ton load that puts us at\n175 days, give or take to unload the ship.</p>\n<p>You could cut through the ship - <a href=\"https://jalopnik.com/a-chain-just-cut-through-a-capsized-cargo-ship-filled-w-1845784581\">it’s been done before</a>.  It’d be a huge\nloss for ths shipping company, though.  It’d also take many months, and\nwould likely destroy all of the cargo.</p>\n<p>You could do what they do with beached whales - just blow it up.  Evaporate\nit with an ICBM.  Let’s ignore various nuclear arms treaties and ecological\nissues involved.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGM-118_Peacekeeper\">LGM-118 Peacekeeper</a> is armed with a 300 kiloton\nW87 warhead.  Unfortunately, the Ever Given is just too big.  It would not\nbe completely destroyed as the fireball is only 320 meters and various\nleftover scrap metal would be all over the place.  Upgrading to something\nthat would make the UN sweat a little, though, and we could probably\ncreate a big enough crater to allow for U-turns.</p>\n<p>My favorite, though… is to just explode a medium sized nuke under the ship.\nThen another.  Then another.  Just keep exploding nukes until it’s sailing\noff into the cosmos.  We’d have accomplished <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion)\">Project Orion</a>.\nOpen up the Suez canal and ship goods to Mars in one fell swoop!</p>\n<p>In the end, the Suez canal was cleared by high tide, dredging the canal,\nand a bunch of tug boats.
