It’s not just\nan indicator of your originating geography but also the cultural upbringing\nyou had.  Over the next few weeks I’ll be picking out a few different\nlanguage dialects to both learn about and write about.</p>\n<p>To start with, a dialect that’s near and dear to me: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_English\">Appalachian English</a>,\nalso known as Smoky Mountain English or Southern Mountain English.  This is\nthe dialect that’s most often attributed to the inland Southern United States\nand has many features of 18th-century colonial English.  I’d often encounter\nthis dialect with my family in Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Viriginia.</p>\n<p>Some of the words I’ve picked up over time that I can think of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">afeared</code> - to be afraid</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">buggy</code> - a shopping cart</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">britches</code> - pants</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">crick</code> - this may be either a stiffness of joints in the body or a creek</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">fixin</code> - this can also be a few things - either to say something is soon to\nhappen, or a portion of food</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">holler</code> - the steep valley between two hills, because you can “holler”\nacross to the other side</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">plumb</code> - completely</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">reckon</code> - suppose</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">skifting</code> - a dusting, usually of snow on the ground</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">sody-pop</code> - carbonated beverages</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">spell</code> - either a duration of time or the state of being lightheaded</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">yonder</code> - somewhere distant, away from where we are currently</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Appalachian English has many other archaic phrases, words, and prefixes.<br>\nMost of the above fall into that - either from older English words like\n<code class=\"language-text\">breetches</code> or the <code class=\"language-text\">a-</code> (such as <code class=\"language-text\">afeared</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">a-haunted</code>) prefix which comes\nfrom Early Middle English.  <code class=\"language-text\">right</code> can also be used with adjectives and\nadverbs such as <code class=\"language-text\">right fine</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">right quick</code>.</p>\n<p>Southern drawl is also an important aspect of this dialect.  Sourthern Drawl -\nconsidered <a href=\"http://dialectblog.com/2011/04/20/twangs-vs-drawls/\">different from the Southern twang</a> - is a common\npattern in how the vowels are prolonged making the speech sound slower.\nTo many, this leads to the incorrect assumption that\nan individual with a drawl is <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/why-does-a-southern-drawl-sound-uneducated-to-some/\">uneducated or dim-witted</a>.\nPart of this is from a lack of exposure to Southern accents - people that\ndon’t hear it can immediately hear the other-ness.  However, even people that\ngrow up with the accent are told that a Southern accent is “wrong” via\npop-culture and media.  How many celebrities speak with a Southern drawl?</p>\n<p>Dialects like this might sound strange to people that aren’t part of them.\nHowever, to those that are within that dialect outsiders without it sound\nforeign.  To quote my cousins in regards to my differing dialect,\n“Yew talk real funny!  Y’all spake all fast-like.  Yer a yankee from up\nyonder, aintcha?”</p>","excerpt":"Regional Dialects are something of an interesting topic for me.
