None of this is true, but it’s not like the vacuum\nof space is really all that hospitable.</p>\n<p>There’s a neat <a href=\"https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2013/space-human-body/\">blog post from 2013</a> that backs me up on this, but\nfor the most part: going out in to space without a space suit\nis inadvisable, just for different reasons.  There’s the issue of\nradiation, vacuum, and a distinct lack of oxygen.</p>\n<p>Within a few seconds, you’d feel slightly warm, not cold, in space.\nSure, space is cold but there’s very little transfer of temperature.\nThis is because there’s no matter in space to transfer heat via conduction\nor convection.  Instead, all you’ve got is thermal radiation.\nThis means either heat will be being radiating to you slowly from\nthe sun or heat will be radiating off of you slowly.  You won’t\nbecome a popsicle.</p>\n<p>The vacuum of space is dangerous, but not in the same way that you\nwhere people pop like a balloon.  Instead, you’ll see some tissue\nswelling from water vapor under the skin, with some pretty gnarly\nbruises.  However, this can also end up causing gas bubbles to form\nwithin the bloodstream which can be incredibly deadly.\nAnother issue is that the decompression will cause the air in\nlungs to expand to an extent that could be incredibly dangerous.\nSo, Pro-Tip: Before taking a space walk without a space suit,\nexhale as much as you can.</p>\n<p>The vacuum of space means a lack of matter, though.  Oxygen\nis matter.  Often times, humans need oxygen to survive.  This is\nwhere we come into our third problem: you can’t breathe in space,\nand worse, because of the vacuum the lungs actually will REMOVE\noxygen from the blood stream.  In under 30 seconds, you will\nstart getting deoxygenated blood to the brain, and it’s lights\nout.  Suffice it to say, it’s downhill from there.</p>\n<p>So, short version?  Don’t go into space without a pressure suit\nand a steady supply of oxygen.</p>","excerpt":"For some reason, any time you see someone in a movie go into space\nwithout a space suit you invariably see them explode, freeze, or\nsomehow…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-06-04"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/06/04"}},"previous":{"id":"20311997-a4c2-5c84-9d04-9cc256fdccac","fields":{"slug":"/2021-05-26"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/05/26"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-06-04","previous":"/2021-05-26","next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
