The English language is ever-evolving and with over 500,000 words in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dictionaries_by_number_of_words\" title=\"List of dictionaries by number of words\">Wiktionary</a> the amount of choice available to you can be overwhelming.  Beyond that, the many complex ways it can be combined and misused to form prose adds yet another layer.</p>\n<p>However, it doesn’t have to be that way!  There are constructed languages (“conlang”) which have much fewer words and are much simpler to understand. </p>\n<p>Esperanto is one such language, and with a little over 16,000 words you have to take the complex ideas down to simplify them so that they can be expressed in <em>simpla</em> terms.  It’s the most widely spoken constructed language, and was designed with the hopes that the grammar could be <em>komprenita</em> within an hour.</p>\n<p>While Esperanto is simple, we can always aim for a simpler crafted language.  Klingon is one such language - a language designed for the Klingon people, a race of <em>Suv</em> from the planet Klingon.  With at most 4,000 words, the language is heavily skewed towards battle because they are the antagonistic and combative folk in the television show Star Trek - so those are the words they use!  Most of their time is spent on the <em>che’ron</em>.  The culture of the Klingons are reflected in their language and the restrictions within.</p>\n<p>How simple can a language be, while still including the capability of expressing complex ideas?  Meet Toki Pona.  This language, literally meaning “the language of good”, consists of just 125 words and a relatively simple grammar - taking about 30 hours to be a strong <em>toki</em> of the language.   But how does that <em>pali</em>?  Toki Pona was designed around a small <em>nanpa</em> of simple near-universal concepts, with more complex concepts achieved through combining them.  For example, there’s no words for “friend” or “enemy”, but “jan pona” (person + good) and “jan ike” (person + bad) could stand in for those <em>ijo</em>.  <em>Toki wile li pali sina pona</em>, <em>pona jan li  pali pana ale</em>.
