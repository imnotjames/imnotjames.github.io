Games that he’s worked\non include Drakengard, SINoALICE, Nier, and Nier: Automata.  He’s pushed video games in\nextreme ways that create beautiful experiences.  There’s a level of polish and finesse\nexhibited.  <a href=\"https://www.platinumgames.com/official-blog/article/9581\">Platinum Games published a post about the music</a> in Nier Automata that\nI found really interesting.</p>\n<p>The music is all over the place in really amazing and interesting ways.  One thing which\nmakes it interesting is the vocals are <a href=\"https://www.platinumgames.com/official-blog/article/9581\">often a mix of languages</a>, between old Gaelic,\nFrench, Japanese, and English. This means no matter what you speak it is slightly foreign\nand like it’s from another time and place.</p>\n<p>In Nier: Automata parts of the game are “Hacking” sections.  At these points the game’s\nmusic switches over to an “8-bit” version which is much lower fidelity and sounds\nreminiscent of older video games instead of the orchestra of the normal soundtrack.</p>\n<p>However, not all pieces of their score for NieR: Automata received an 8-bit track -\nfor the amount of music they have it was nearly untenable.  Part of this has to do\nwith some of the systems they had around mixing different tracks together.\nThey instead developed a system that automatically created the chiptune music from\nthe traditional orchestral score.</p>\n<p>This was done by creating determing 48 tones filtered out of the score via a sine\nwave, more or less bucketing the octaves, distorting them aggressively, and then\nremoving anything that was below a specific level to make the output clearer.</p>\n<p>You can see how it <a href=\"https://youtu.be/p3AdmriQn00\">worked in practice on their Youtube channel</a>.</p>","excerpt":"Yoko Taro is an incredibly talented video game director and writer.
