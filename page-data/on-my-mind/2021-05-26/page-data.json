James Bond, the Addams Family, Stargate, The Lord of the Rings, </p>\n<p>There’s a famous anti-trust case,  <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Paramount_Pictures,_Inc.\">US vs Paramount</a>, which put an end\nto the Hollywood studio system.  In the old system we had <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_film_studios#The_majors_during_the_Golden_Age\">The Big Five studios</a> -\nwhich included MGM - and they had a 90% ownership over the film market.</p>\n<p>The studios had actors that had exclusive contracts, they made films that they owned\nexclusive rights to, and would only release them in theaters owned by the studio.\nThe studios owned the entire vertical and it prevented  smaller studios from\nbreaking into the market.  They couldn’t get actors.  They couldn’t get\ntheir pictures up on screens.</p>\n<p>This is all very similar now to the big VOD streaming companies.  But hey,\nthere’s legal precedent to prevent history from repeating itself, right?\nWell.. not exactly.  On August 7th, 2020, the DOJ reversed the decision\nand added a termination period to the decree.  This was heavily opposed by\nindependent movie theater owners.  By the time Amazon acquires MGM this\nwill be completely reversed and Amazon will continue to burninate the\ncountryside, gobbling up as much as possible.  All it takes is for Amazon\nto buy AMC.</p>\n<p>Now we’ll have a new Big Five: Netflix, Youtube, Amazon, Hulu, and Dinsey+ <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Presentations-and-Whitepapers/2020/State-of-OTT\">take up 85%</a>\nof the streaming market.  Art for Art’s sake, right?</p>","excerpt":"Amazon is starting its acquisition of MGM for a whole lotta cash.\nThis is a bid to try to buy the defeat of Netflix via Amazon Prime…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-05-26"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/05/26"}},"previous":{"id":"3e4337b2-d7d1-55be-b6e6-5b1ebc2623b2","fields":{"slug":"/2021-05-25"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/05/25"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-05-26","previous":"/2021-05-25","next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
