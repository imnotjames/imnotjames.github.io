Get better at self-care, do some yoga, use those new-fangled\nmeditation apps.  Those might help soothe some of the pains caused by chronic stress, but they don’t get to the\nactual causes of it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246546370_Making_a_significant_difference_with_burnout_interventions_Researcher_and_practitioner_collaboration\">A 2012 Study by Christina Maslach, Michael Leither and Susan Jackson</a> point at the causes\nof burnout to be more organizational than personal.  The top cause?  Unsustainable workload.  Also in there\nis the lack of a supportive community.</p>\n<p>If you take a look over the <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w27612\">NBER’s working paper on the impact of COVID-19</a> - what do you see?\nRemote workers on average work 10% more during all of this.  People also have more shorter meetings than ever\nbefore.  You end up with a heavier workload and sparser, shorter action-oriented meetings - without the same\naffordances given to social interactions unrelated to the work at hand.</p>\n<p>The HBR article I’d linked above did a survey of 1500 workers - and found that nearly 90% said that their\nwork life was getting worse, more than half said their work was becoming more demanding, and half felt that\nthey couldn’t maintain a strong connection with their friends.</p>\n<p>This isn’t really a new phenomenon, either.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067175527180513280?lang=en\">Some CEOs of public companies have been pushing for 80\nhours a week of work</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/how-ubers-hard-charging-corporate-culture-left-employees\">Uber’s employees were effectively not sleeping</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html\">Amazon worked people to exhaustion on Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving weekend</a>, and if you\nwant to hear me go off about even my personal experience, just ask me about Venmo’s practices.\nThe superbowl “war room” that literally means being in the office for 24 hours without sleep is\njust the tip of that iceberg.</p>\n<p>Really, though - what I’m trying to say is that burnout is very real, very scary, and it’s gotta get\naddressed sometime.  I don’t think that time is now, but it’s gotta be soon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/research-rheingans-digital-enablers-five-hour-workday-productivity\">Maybe the 5 hour work day could become the norm</a>.  I doubt it though.</p>","excerpt":"In 2019, the World Health Organization recognized burnout as an occupational phenomenon in the ICD-11.\nHowever, a relatively new article by…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-18"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/18"}},"previous":{"id":"6f6178fe-3e96-55e5-895b-83e2c69e03aa","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-17"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/17"}},"next":{"id":"96f29b98-fb55-577b-862f-1ac05321de07","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-19"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/19"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-02-18","previous":"/2021-02-17","next":"/2021-02-19"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
