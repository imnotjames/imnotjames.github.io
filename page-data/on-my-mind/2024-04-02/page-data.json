Lasse, Collin, a developer that was the sole developer\nmaintaining <code class=\"language-text\">xz</code> - a linux utility used widely - started receiving help from <code class=\"language-text\">JiaT75</code> -\nsomeone named Jia Tan.  Tan kept fixing bugs, opening pull requests, and generally being\nhelpful.  Eventually, Collin had granted Tan access to commit directly to the repository.\nThey were a trusted helper, after all!  Tan then took responsibility of managing releases,\nhelping with various security websites interactions with the project, and made life easier\nfor Collin.</p>\n<p>This year, Tan helped usher in version <code class=\"language-text\">5.6.0</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">5.6.1</code> of <code class=\"language-text\">xz</code>.  Tan dutifully continued\nto be helpful and encouraged various linux distribution maintainers to include these new\nversions - they had security fixes, of course!  Some did, some didn’t.  Reviewing the code,\nit was unclear if the security fixes were major enough to warrant updating.  This version\nended up in “testing” versions of Debian, Redhat, and Kali linux - but these are large distributions\nused on millions of computers.</p>\n<p>By chance, Andre Freund - a linux developer over at Microsoft - became frustrated that their SSH\nclient was taking 500ms longer to connect that day.  It wasn’t clear to them why all of a sudden\neverything was half a second slower, and sure: it wasn’t the end of the world by any means but it\nwas ANNOYING.  So they dug.  They found something that was surprising.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Jia Tan was not who they claimed to be.  Tan was not just a helpful contributor.\nTan was an agent of a nation state with a very specific goal - infiltration. They used their position\nto hide code inside of xz that could be used to execute arbitrary malicious payloads - and then used\ntheir role as security contact to prevent folks from finding it.  Version 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 of xz included\nthis code.  Nobody noticed - that is, until Andre Freund.</p>\n<p>If Andre hadn’t decided to inspect an annoyance this backdoor would have been everywhere.  Every bank,\nevery government, most every cell phone.  This was all caught because someone didn’t want to wait half a\nsecond longer.</p>\n<p>The Lasse Collin is currently suggesting to use an old version that doesn’t have ANY of Jia Tan’s code in it - <code class=\"language-text\">5.3.1</code>.</p>\n<p>Some real spy stuff, right?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/what-we-know-about-the-xz-utils-backdoor-that-almost-infected-the-world/\">Arstechnica has a more detailed write up</a>, and Lasse Collin has some stuff\nabout it <a href=\"https://tukaani.org/xz-backdoor/\">on their site</a> - but they’re <a href=\"https://lkml.org/lkml/2024/3/30/188\">currently on vacation</a> and won’t be able\nto do much until they get back.</p>","excerpt":"The whole  thing is mind boggling.
