Don’t want to delve into\nthe madness and incantations needed to utilize <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses\">new curses</a>?</p>\n<p>There’s a <a href=\"https://www.willmcgugan.com/blog/tech/post/building-rich-terminal-dashboards/\">new blog post by Will McGugan</a> about his <a href=\"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich\">Python library Rich</a>,\nused to create beautiful CLIs.  The blog post details some basic\ncreation of dashboards using the various APIs available through Rich.\nHaving written a few things with ncurses, I can safely say that this\nis a much more pleasant experience.</p>\n<p>But what about folks over in javascript land?  Heck, while I love\nPython I also adore Javascript.</p>\n<p>Check out <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blessed/neo-blessed\">blessed</a>, <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blessed/blessed-contrib\">blessed-contrib</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-blessed\">react-blessed</a>.  Blessed is a\nJavascript library to create CLIs, but you’ll notice that the react API\nit has is really game changing.  Using a special <code class=\"language-text\">blessed</code> renderer in React\nyou can create CLI interfaces with the same paradigms as any React 16\napplication.  Combine that with the contrib package and you can have real\ntime terminal dashboards that show graphs, maps, spark lines, markdown,\nand even picture rendering.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing to show off your cool new graphical web app.  It’s another\nentirely to show off your 100% hacker terminal app.</p>","excerpt":"Have you ever wanted to make an interface for a program, but\nrealized web just isn’t for you?
