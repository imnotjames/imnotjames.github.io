In their case, they ran into\nsome of the same deprecation issues outside as they saw culturally on the inside.\nComparing it to AWS, there is a pretty stark difference in the deprecation policy\nof old technology that isn’t actively being developed on.</p>\n<p>Deprecation isn’t the only oddity.  Quota increases can be weird, too - AWS asked me\nto get my quota upped why and I wrote something, I don’t think they read it, and then\nthey upped it.  With Google, it was faster than AWS but I did have to talk to someone\non the phone in sales.  It felt weird.  Perhaps it’s a way to increase touch points\nand push people to use more at GCP?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-brass-set-2023-as-deadline-to-beat-amazon-microsoft-in-cloud\">Google has gone on record saying that they’ll end the GCP projects</a> if they don’t\noutclass Azure or AWS or the like.  That’s a tall order, and would require a much heavier\nmarketing and engineering push than I’ve been seeing.  They set the deadline to 2023,\nso I’m sure we’ll see Google Cloud shutting down before 2025.</p>\n<p>Who knows, though, I’ve heard rumors of folks dog-fooding Google Cloud internally.\nIf Google Cloud could sign a deal as big as Google onto their cloud, I’m sure they’d\nquickly outrank AWS, right?</p>","excerpt":"Google Cloud is terrifying to some people because of Google’s policy of axeing products\nall around.
