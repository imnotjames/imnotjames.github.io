They did\nthis by intentionally introducing bad code via merge requests to the Linux\nkernel, leading to vulnerabilities.  Some of the 190 commits have\n<a href=\"https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/8e949363f017\">even landed in stable branches</a>.</p>\n<p>Ethically, this is an\nunacceptable behavior for experimentation, and has been reported to the UMN\nInstitutional Review Board on these cases.  Ethics complaints have also been\nfiled to IEEE to have the publication revoked, but it’s unlikely that it will\nbe.  They’ve also been <a href=\"https://lore.kernel.org/linux-nfs/YH%2FfM%2FTsbmcZzwnX@kroah.com/\">banned, as a University, from contributing</a> to the\nLinux kernel, as well as from communicating through many Linux kernel mailing\nlists.</p>\n<p>Their experiments prove that humans are fallible.
