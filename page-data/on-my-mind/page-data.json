It’s no surprise that we crave human interaction\nwhen we can’t see one another!  However, Zoom just feels too… meeting-ish.\nCommunities don’t really form around Zoom.  I think that’s why folks are\nturning to more “video game”-like aspects to break the physical distances\nbetween us.</p>\n<p>When we’re meeting in person, we’re usually limited by physics.  This is\nsomething we’re really used to.  You can only have so many people in a room,\nyou can’t really hear folks outside of a short distance away, and you know\nwhen someone is talking to you because they are usually giving you their\nattention.</p>\n<p>So - simulating those physical limitations has been seen in a few products\n(games?  tools?  communication devices?) that’ve been dropping.  I’d first\nseen something like this at the Recurse Center - they have Virtual RC &#x26; it’s\nreally neat!  It’s like being in the RC space but you’re represented by just\na little avatar version of your face.  I think there’s a few other ways that\nthis can work - and products show that’s the case as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waxy.org/2021/02/announcing-skittish/\">Skittish</a> is one of these - and I saw it on the front page of Hacker\nNews.  You get an avatar that’s a Raccoon or an Owl or a snake - and you\nhang out in a virtual space, watch videos together, all that.  It’s neat,\nbut definitely limited in what it can do. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gather.town/\">Gather.town</a> is a bit older, and if I remember correctly had Pokemon\nsprites to begin with, way back.  A few college students tossed it together\nand put it up online &#x26; it grew like wildfire.</p>\n<p>To go a bit more realistic, there’s <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/\">Hub by Mozilla</a>.  This is available\nvia VR and feels much more video-gamey than the others.  You can easily modify\nthe space you’re in and customize it together with other people.  I’ve seen\na number of other examples like this - the closest being Rec Room.</p>\n<p>There’s still <a href=\"https://www.connect.secondlife.com/about\">Second Life</a> and Second Life has been around.. forever.\nThing is… Second Life gets weird.  Real weird.  Let’s not think about that\ntoo much.</p>\n<p>I think there’s always a want for Human connection, though.  It doesn’t even\nhave to be instant.  Sometimes you just want to listen to some chilled out\nmusic and write letters to people via a deer postman.\n<a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070710/Kind_Words_lo_fi_chill_beats_to_write_to/\">Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to)</a> gives you that experience.\nKind Words is about writing nice letters and reading nice letters from other\npeople.  It makes you feel much better inside than many other interactions.</p>\n<p>To be honest?  I think we need less Zoom and we need more Kind Words\nin the world.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-23"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/23","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/2A0jXvUa3KOufBYT53/giphy-downsized.gif\"></p>\n<p>There were two posts on the front page of Hacker News yesterday -\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26211721\">Choose Boring Technology</a> and <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26212563\">Choose Exciting Technology</a>.\nBoth make are great points and are compelling on their own, but they’re\ncompletely at odds with one another.</p>\n<p>Boring Technology gives examples like PHP, Postgres, Java, and all other\nsorts of technology that’s been around for a while and is.. well.. not as\nnew and shiny.  Battle-tested technology.  Things that everyone on the team\nknows.  The argument for boring technology is generally that you won’t\nget anything that surprises you.</p>\n<p>Exciting Technology is … uh.. okay, so bear with me: the examples given\nare Cassandra (at least 12 years old), MongoDB (>11 years),\nClojure (>14 years), and NodeJS (..let’s not touch that).  For the sake of\nsimplicity, let’s say Exciting Technology is technology that an\nengineer is less familiar with and as such cannot for certain say\nthat it will solve the issues they currently have - but there are\nsome shiny new features that they really like!</p>\n<p>Let’s … not talk touch on my personal experiences with Cassandra, Mongo,\nand the like.  Let’s not touch on the issues that seemed to be the case\nat Etsy’s SRE &#x26; maintenance of servers.  Let’s not even touch on all the\nfighting going on in the HN comments.</p>\n<p>Instead, I think it’s interesting to talk about the kinds of people\nthat do this because I don’t think that either of these articles will\nchange people’s minds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering-dp-1484221575/dp/1484221575/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\">Managing Humans by Michael Lopp</a> is a book that’s not just about\nmanaging humans.  In it he writes about engineering culture, different\npersonalities you might find, and communication skills.  Things that are\nsometimes considered tangential to management (but are very important!)</p>\n<p>The chapter “Stables and Volatiles” details two archetypes that you’ll\ncommonly see within engineering cultures. </p>\n<p>Stables are engineers that happily work within a set of confines - even\nappreciating these confines such as direction and deadlines.  They assess\nrisk, carefully mitigate failure, and aim for predictable outcomes.</p>\n<p>Volatiles will show up, stomp on everything that exists, and leave a trail\nof disruption in their wake.  However, when they build.. they sure build a LOT.\nIn some cases, what they make will be novel and would not have occurred\notherwise.</p>\n<p>Stables and Volatiles are at odds with one another.  They do not get along\non everything but a team with both can be incredibly successful - even if\nthere’s a bit of conflict along the way.  Volatiles become stables,\nand sometime stables become volatiles, and neither is really good or bad.\nThey just <em>are</em>.</p>\n<p>These archetypes are applicable to the argument about boring versus exciting\ntechnology.  Stables will more likely than not choose the familiar.\nVolatiles will sometimes choose the foreign.  Neither is right or wrong -\nat least not intrinsically.  Instead, it’s gotta be a balance and you’ve\ngot to use the right tool for the right job.</p>\n<p>If you lean too far towards boring technology nothing will be pushed forward.\nIf you lean too far towards the exciting you’ll end up with a backend written\nin <a href=\"https://www.little-lang.org/\">Little</a> using a home-grown <a href=\"https://dfithian.github.io/2021/02/15/database-implementation-part-1.html\">database written in Haskell</a>.

The mission is one of the most ambitious\nwe’ve sent to the red planet - but not just because of the rover\n(which, itself, is the most complex and featured rover we’ve sent).</p>\n<p>The EDL (Entry, Descent, and Landing) platform was also for more advanced\nthan any other we’d sent - with the descent into the Martian atmosphere\nbeing yet another part of the experiment.  The ablative heat shielding\ncovered the bottom of the capsule - with a type of plating covering it\nwhich upon heating would vaporize and be carried away from the\nPerseverance capsule.</p>\n<p>The Perseverance also carried 661lbs of tungsten weights.  However, just\nbecause they’re dead weight doesn’t mean they won’t serve a purpose.</p>\n<p>Two 165 pound blocks of tungsten kept Perseverance in a stable and balanced\nspin on its journey from Earth.  This prevented any one side of the capsule\nfrom getting too hot.  These are jettisoned 900 miles or so above Mars as\nthey’d no longer be needed.  Waste not, though.  These two tungsten blocks\nwill slam into the surface of Mars at 9,000 mph or so and is\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/science/nasa-mars-landing.html\">part of a very vital experiment</a>.  The InSight lander has a\nseismometer and even at 2000 miles away it’ll be listening for Perseverance\nknocking with these tungsten payloads.</p>\n<p>Removing those two tungsten blocks is an important part of the entry phase\nbecause while balance is required during the journey, the entry requires\ndebalancing.  Because one side of the capsule is heavier than the other\nthe entry angle will be at 16°.  This leads to a slight amount of lift\nexperienced by the craft, allowing the descent to be controlled via\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system\">RCS (Reaction Control System)</a> powered rotation - rotate left to\ncause the lift to push you one way, right to push the other, and go left\nand right consistently to burn off speed.  This is all autonomous!</p>\n<p>There’s also six 55lb tungsten masses that ensure landing is aligned.\nThese are jettisoned right before firing the parachute and are used to\nensure that the radar will be oriented in the correct direction.  While\nthe RCS was fired roughly 2,256 times during atmosphere entry, at this point\nthey aren’t a whole lot of use.  These tungsten blocks are jettisoned two at\na time, and will cause the craft to roll into the exact orientation needed\nfor the rest of the descent.</p>\n<p>Haven’t heard yet if InSight heard Perseverance’s hello to start a welcome\nparty, but all of this was fantastically interesting to me and I’m always\nsurprised at how much NASA can achieve.</p>\n<p>Wanna watch it?  <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/919215638\">They streamed the landing on twitch!</a>\nWhat an amazing future we live in.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-19"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/19","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>\n            <img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/cVWZ8dVs5VOEvdhH1M/giphy.gif' alt='null' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<p>In 2019, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases\">recognized burnout as an occupational phenomenon in the ICD-11</a>.\nHowever, a relatively new <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/02/beyond-burned-out\">article by HBR about burnout points at studies</a> that show the pandemic has\nbeen causing burnout to run rampant since early 2020.  “Knowledge workers” are now mostly working remotely -\nlooking at Zoom, for example, they went from 10 million to 200 million active users effectively overnight.</p>\n<p>To clarify: Burnout is really just another term for chronic stress causing emotional, mental, and even physical damage.</p>\n<p>Lots of companies just look at it as a personal problem.  Get better at self-care, do some yoga, use those new-fangled\nmeditation apps.

The top cause?  Unsustainable workload.

People also have more shorter meetings than ever\nbefore.  You end up with a heavier workload and sparser, shorter action-oriented meetings - without the same\naffordances given to social interactions unrelated to the work at hand.</p>\n<p>The HBR article I’d linked above did a survey of 1500 workers - and found that nearly 90% said that their\nwork life was getting worse, more than half said their work was becoming more demanding, and half felt that\nthey couldn’t maintain a strong connection with their friends.</p>\n<p>This isn’t really a new phenomenon, either.  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1067175527180513280?lang=en\">Some CEOs of public companies have been pushing for 80\nhours a week of work</a>, <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolineodonovan/how-ubers-hard-charging-corporate-culture-left-employees\">Uber’s employees were effectively not sleeping</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html\">Amazon worked people to exhaustion on Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving weekend</a>, and if you\nwant to hear me go off about even my personal experience, just ask me about Venmo’s practices.\nThe superbowl “war room” that literally means being in the office for 24 hours without sleep is\njust the tip of that iceberg.</p>\n<p>Really, though - what I’m trying to say is that burnout is very real, very scary, and it’s gotta get\naddressed sometime.
