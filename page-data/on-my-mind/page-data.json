It’s not worth\nunpacking all of that.  It really isn’t.  I promise you.</p>\n<p>Instead, let’s chat about how this happened.  It’s pretty simple.</p>\n<p>The site in question had <a href=\"https://archive.vn/oxbck\">a commit</a> from the Gab CTO which migrated a\nspecific SQL query away from the library abstraction SQL and into raw SQL -\nthe query language used to interact more directly with their database.\nThis is often done because a custom SQL query can often be used to greatly\nimprove performance.</p>\n<p>However…</p>\n<p>As part of this, they used string interpolation do craft the query.  String\ninterpolation is kinda like saying <code class=\"language-text\">VARIABLE_U</code> is <code class=\"language-text\">james</code> and I want to\ninterpolate that into <code class=\"language-text\">SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = &#39;$VARIABLE_U&#39;</code> so\nthat I end up with the final string of <code class=\"language-text\">SELECT * FROM WHERE username = &#39;james&#39;</code>.</p>\n<p>Simple, right?</p>\n<p>This way of crafting SQL can fail because of what is known as\n<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection\">SQL Injection</a>. In our example, what if <code class=\"language-text\">VARIABLE_U</code> was coming from an\ninput field on a website?  In that case, a user could type whatever they wanted\ninto that field.</p>\n<p>If a user was to type in <code class=\"language-text\">&#39; OR &#39;a&#39; = &#39;a</code>, the final string would then look\nsomething like <code class=\"language-text\">SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = &#39;&#39; OR &#39;a&#39; = &#39;a&#39;</code>.\nInstead of limiting to a single <code class=\"language-text\">username</code> value, we’d instead retrieve any\nusers.</p>\n<p>This can be elaborated on to do even more - such as with\n<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_SQL_Injection\">Blind SQL Injection</a> techniques.</p>\n<p>How should they instead of handled this?  By using the library to “bind”\nparameters.  <a href=\"https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Querying.html#method-i-find_by_sql\">Ruby on Rails</a> supports this in the function used by the\nchange that caused the breach.</p>\n<p>In our example, we could instead write the query as\n<code class=\"language-text\">SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = ?</code> and then tell the library to bind\n<code class=\"language-text\">VARIABLE_U</code> to the first numbered parameter.  No string interpolation would\nbe performed, and with most databases the query would be sent over completely\nseparate from the bound parameters!</p>\n<p>This should have been caught in code review.  I mean.. if they do code\nreview, right?</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-03"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/03/03","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/5niBMBXRnhmlmMWCun/giphy-downsized.gif\"></p>\n<p>Regional Dialects are something of an interesting topic for me.  It’s not just\nan indicator of your originating geography but also the cultural upbringing\nyou had.  Over the next few weeks I’ll be picking out a few different\nlanguage dialects to both learn about and write about.</p>\n<p>To start with, a dialect that’s near and dear to me: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_English\">Appalachian English</a>,\nalso known as Smoky Mountain English or Southern Mountain English.  This is\nthe dialect that’s most often attributed to the inland Southern United States\nand has many features of 18th-century colonial English.  I’d often encounter\nthis dialect with my family in Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Viriginia.</p>\n<p>Some of the words I’ve picked up over time that I can think of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">afeared</code> - to be afraid</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">buggy</code> - a shopping cart</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">britches</code> - pants</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">crick</code> - this may be either a stiffness of joints in the body or a creek</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">fixin</code> - this can also be a few things - either to say something is soon to\nhappen, or a portion of food</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">holler</code> - the steep valley between two hills, because you can “holler”\nacross to the other side</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">plumb</code> - completely</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">reckon</code> - suppose</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">skifting</code> - a dusting, usually of snow on the ground</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">sody-pop</code> - carbonated beverages</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">spell</code> - either a duration of time or the state of being lightheaded</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">yonder</code> - somewhere distant, away from where we are currently</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Appalachian English has many other archaic phrases, words, and prefixes.<br>\nMost of the above fall into that - either from older English words like\n<code class=\"language-text\">breetches</code> or the <code class=\"language-text\">a-</code> (such as <code class=\"language-text\">afeared</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">a-haunted</code>) prefix which comes\nfrom Early Middle English.  <code class=\"language-text\">right</code> can also be used with adjectives and\nadverbs such as <code class=\"language-text\">right fine</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">right quick</code>.</p>\n<p>Southern drawl is also an important aspect of this dialect.  Sourthern Drawl -\nconsidered <a href=\"http://dialectblog.com/2011/04/20/twangs-vs-drawls/\">different from the Southern twang</a> - is a common\npattern in how the vowels are prolonged making the speech sound slower.\nTo many, this leads to the incorrect assumption that\nan individual with a drawl is <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/why-does-a-southern-drawl-sound-uneducated-to-some/\">uneducated or dim-witted</a>.\nPart of this is from a lack of exposure to Southern accents - people that\ndon’t hear it can immediately hear the other-ness.  However, even people that\ngrow up with the accent are told that a Southern accent is “wrong” via\npop-culture and media.  How many celebrities speak with a Southern drawl?</p>\n<p>Dialects like this might sound strange to people that aren’t part of them.\nHowever, to those that are within that dialect outsiders without it sound\nforeign.  To quote my cousins in regards to my differing dialect,\n“Yew talk real funny!  Y’all spake all fast-like.  Yer a yankee from up\nyonder, aintcha?”</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-02"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/03/02","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/1gRtl9mdLQvvvOfR9u/giphy-downsized.gif\"></p>\n<p>Social engineering is one of the most difficult attack vectors to detect.  It’s\nalso one of the oldest technqiues in the espionage handbook.  Most of the time\nin this day and age it’s implemented as spear-phishing or in other ways via\nemail.  That’s when you aren’t dealing with highly motivated nation-state\nactors where money and time becomes less of a problem.</p>\n<p>Let’s think like a threat actor for a moment.  Who’s going to look the most\nthreatening to an employee?  The other, of course.  Someone outside the company.\nThat’s why spear-phishing can be so successful - you purport to be someone\ntrusted.  Someone that’s a part of the company.  However, that leaves tech in\nthe way.  That makes it easier to detect, right?</p>\n<p>So then.. let’s pivot.  How can we become someone trustworthy?  Well… What\nif we only needed to fool one employee - someone that wouldn’t expect it -\nand use that to get a foot-hold?  How about.. HR.  HR gets a candidate.  On\npaper, they’re perfect.  They came from top schools, they know your stack,\nthe teams that interview them are gung-ho, their references are all gushing\nabout how amazing this individual is.  And that’s exactly how we get someone\non the inside.</p>\n<p>Sound too outlandish?  It has happened many times - even in recent years.\nAlexey Karetnikov had joined Microsoft as a QA engineer in 2010.\n<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/07/who-was-the-12th-russian-spy-at-microsoft/344876/\">It was purported that he was there to capture intelligence</a> for the Russian\nintelligence agencies.  He was on the sloppier side and was tracked by the\nUS intelligence agencies as soon as he set foot in the US.  He was deported\nover charges of immigration violations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/responding-effectively-to-the-chinese-economic-espionage-threat\">The current FBI Director, Christopher Wray, spoke about this as well.</a>\nIn 2020, the Boston FBI field office arrested a researcher that was smuggling\nvials of biological research back to the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>When someone’s as motivated as these folks are and have the backing of a\nnation state nearly anything is possible.  These are just the cases we hear\nabout, too.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Barsky\">Jack Barsky</a> is a more famous example of someone that had\nbeen a spy for the KGB in New York City for 10 years.</p>\n<p>In espionage, reality is often more outlandish than even fiction.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-01"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/03/01","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/S1N2zUokK7jiM/giphy.gif\"></p>\n<p>There are people that claim they can tell you where water is via a dowsing rod.\nWater finding.

Those small movements are known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_phenomenon\">Ideomotor phenomenon</a>.\nIt’s where a mental image or a thought bring on a reflexive muscular action\noutside of conscious knowledge.  It’s the same effect that you’ll see with\nother “precognition-lite” techniques like Ouija boards, automatic writing, and\nfacilitated communication.  (Sorry if I’ve dunked on your preferred\npseudoscience, happy for you to tell me how I’m wrong.) </p>\n<p>It’s been tested again and again and show that it’s a whole bunch of baloney.\nWhile the <a href=\"https://www.scientificexploration.org/docs/9/jse_09_1_betz.pdf\">1990 study by Hans-Dieter Betz</a> concludes that it works,\nbut <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Water-dowsing%3A-TheScheunen-experiments-Enright/a51593dc28ad8c03eb51c2eb6d9e1d0d7db19ed4\">statistical analysis by J. T. Enright in 1995</a> finds that\nout of 500 dowsers even the best of the best were about only 0.4% better than\nrandom chance which could be easily attributed to statistical fluctuation.\nThat’s the most POSITIVE study I can find on it; there’s countless others that\ncall out dowsing as completely fake. Algeria 1943, New Zealand 1948, Britain\n1959, the British Ministry of Defense did one in 1971 - the list goes on and\nevery single one of them show this as a complete farce.</p>\n<p>Even today, <a href=\"https://sallylepage.medium.com/in-2017-uk-water-companies-still-rely-on-magic-6eb62e036b02\">water dowsing is employed by ten out of the twelve</a>\nwater companies in the UK.

The Videocassette Recorder was\nfeared by the television industry and heralded by consumers.\nA new way to consume movies and television was born with the VHS.</p>\n<p>There was one issue with translating theatrical movies to the small screen:\nHome televisions were 4:3 aspect ratio.  This meant that the the screens had\na width of 1.33 times the height unlike the new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinemaScope\">Cinemascope</a> and other\nWidescreen formats for theatrical releases that became popular after 1960.</p>\n<p>Two techniques are available to make the widescreen theatrical releases\nfit on a smaller screen.  There’s always letterboxing - which adds black bars\nabove and below the screen.  Another technique is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_and_scan\">Pan and Scan</a> - where\nthe image is translated to better show off the points of interest in the\ncinematography, shaping the film to match the 4:3 through cropping or other\ntechniques.  This would be done by an editor and could drastically change\nthe tone of a scene if done poorly.  This is why many criticize and refuse\nto release a pan and scan version.</p>\n<p>The kind of film that would do well in the “home cinema” also differed\nfrom what would do well in the theater. </p>\n<p>In the the theater there is less need to keep the audience’s attention -\nthey were stuck there in the building.  At home, you have distractions so a\ndifferent kind of movie can prosper.  Comedy movies like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallrats\">Mallrats</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski\">The Big Lebowski</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space\">Office Space</a> did ABYSMALLY in the theater but\nfound their footing once they were released on VHS.  Some of this is\nattributed to the fact that they can be enjoyed more recreationally and\nsporadically than many other movies that require direct attention.</p>\n<p>The Horror film genre <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(1982_film)\">The Thing</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abyss\">The Abyss</a>, and “slasher” movies like\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_(1978_film)\">Halloween</a> did extraorgdinarily well on VHS.  This could because.. what’s\nscarier than when the monster is.. inside your own house?  On the small screen\nit’s harder to see what’s going on but sometimes that adds to the fear.. plus,\nyou can’t see the zipper so easily on the scary demon monster.</p>\n<p>There’s also some films that wouldn’t be as popular today if it weren’t for\nhome video - such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film)\">Labyrinth</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner\">Blade Runner</a>,\nor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trouble_in_Little_China\">Big Trouble in Little China</a>.

You get the same gritty effects\nused all over videos online - giving a bit of realism that it’s a “found”\ntape.  There’s even an anthology Horror series called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V/H/S\">V/H/S</a> which uses the\nthe look of VHS tapes to hide all of the imperfections of CGI to great effect.</p>\n<p>Myself?

Heck, I only wore shirts\nthat were swag because they were free.  It was great because I wouldn’t have\nto pay for them and they were decently high quality! </p>\n<p>Now a days, I don’t really want that stuff.  The last conference I went to I even\nwon a new computer monitor (thanks, I guess, Asus?) which I promptly gave\nto a friend because I already have a monitor and didn’t want to bring it back\non a train.</p>\n<p>Getting swag can be exciting - except for when I have 10 venmo hoodies, 4 Wayfair\nhoodies, 2 jackets that are branded elsewhere, and now more socks than I know what\nto do with.

It’s no surprise that we crave human interaction\nwhen we can’t see one another!  However, Zoom just feels too… meeting-ish.\nCommunities don’t really form around Zoom.  I think that’s why folks are\nturning to more “video game”-like aspects to break the physical distances\nbetween us.</p>\n<p>When we’re meeting in person, we’re usually limited by physics.  This is\nsomething we’re really used to.  You can only have so many people in a room,\nyou can’t really hear folks outside of a short distance away, and you know\nwhen someone is talking to you because they are usually giving you their\nattention.</p>\n<p>So - simulating those physical limitations has been seen in a few products\n(games?  tools?  communication devices?) that’ve been dropping.  I’d first\nseen something like this at the Recurse Center - they have Virtual RC &#x26; it’s\nreally neat!  It’s like being in the RC space but you’re represented by just\na little avatar version of your face.

You get an avatar that’s a Raccoon or an Owl or a snake - and you\nhang out in a virtual space, watch videos together, all that.  It’s neat,\nbut definitely limited in what it can do. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gather.town/\">Gather.town</a> is a bit older, and if I remember correctly had Pokemon\nsprites to begin with, way back.  A few college students tossed it together\nand put it up online &#x26; it grew like wildfire.</p>\n<p>To go a bit more realistic, there’s <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/\">Hub by Mozilla</a>.  This is available\nvia VR and feels much more video-gamey than the others.  You can easily modify\nthe space you’re in and customize it together with other people.

Real weird.  Let’s not think about that\ntoo much.</p>\n<p>I think there’s always a want for Human connection, though.  It doesn’t even\nhave to be instant.

The mission is one of the most ambitious\nwe’ve sent to the red planet - but not just because of the rover\n(which, itself, is the most complex and featured rover we’ve sent).</p>\n<p>The EDL (Entry, Descent, and Landing) platform was also for more advanced\nthan any other we’d sent - with the descent into the Martian atmosphere\nbeing yet another part of the experiment.  The ablative heat shielding\ncovered the bottom of the capsule - with a type of plating covering it\nwhich upon heating would vaporize and be carried away from the\nPerseverance capsule.</p>\n<p>The Perseverance also carried 661lbs of tungsten weights.  However, just\nbecause they’re dead weight doesn’t mean they won’t serve a purpose.</p>\n<p>Two 165 pound blocks of tungsten kept Perseverance in a stable and balanced\nspin on its journey from Earth.  This prevented any one side of the capsule\nfrom getting too hot.  These are jettisoned 900 miles or so above Mars as\nthey’d no longer be needed.  Waste not, though.  These two tungsten blocks\nwill slam into the surface of Mars at 9,000 mph or so and is\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/science/nasa-mars-landing.html\">part of a very vital experiment</a>.  The InSight lander has a\nseismometer and even at 2000 miles away it’ll be listening for Perseverance\nknocking with these tungsten payloads.</p>\n<p>Removing those two tungsten blocks is an important part of the entry phase\nbecause while balance is required during the journey, the entry requires\ndebalancing.  Because one side of the capsule is heavier than the other\nthe entry angle will be at 16°.  This leads to a slight amount of lift\nexperienced by the craft, allowing the descent to be controlled via\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system\">RCS (Reaction Control System)</a> powered rotation - rotate left to\ncause the lift to push you one way, right to push the other, and go left\nand right consistently to burn off speed.  This is all autonomous!</p>\n<p>There’s also six 55lb tungsten masses that ensure landing is aligned.\nThese are jettisoned right before firing the parachute and are used to\nensure that the radar will be oriented in the correct direction.  While\nthe RCS was fired roughly 2,256 times during atmosphere entry, at this point\nthey aren’t a whole lot of use.  These tungsten blocks are jettisoned two at\na time, and will cause the craft to roll into the exact orientation needed\nfor the rest of the descent.</p>\n<p>Haven’t heard yet if InSight heard Perseverance’s hello to start a welcome\nparty, but all of this was fantastically interesting to me and I’m always\nsurprised at how much NASA can achieve.</p>\n<p>Wanna watch it?  <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/919215638\">They streamed the landing on twitch!</a>\nWhat an amazing future we live in.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-19"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/19","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>\n            <img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/cVWZ8dVs5VOEvdhH1M/giphy.gif' alt='null' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<p>In 2019, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases\">recognized burnout as an occupational phenomenon in the ICD-11</a>.\nHowever, a relatively new <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/02/beyond-burned-out\">article by HBR about burnout points at studies</a> that show the pandemic has\nbeen causing burnout to run rampant since early 2020.  “Knowledge workers” are now mostly working remotely -\nlooking at Zoom, for example, they went from 10 million to 200 million active users effectively overnight.</p>\n<p>To clarify: Burnout is really just another term for chronic stress causing emotional, mental, and even physical damage.</p>\n<p>Lots of companies just look at it as a personal problem.
