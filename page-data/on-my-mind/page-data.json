Above it.  She kicked off for her third EVA for\nmission <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STS-126\">STS-126</a>.  She was out there with fellow astronaut Stephen Bowen\nto fix the rotation assembly that allows the solar arrays to follow the sun.\nIt had failed and was not operating optimally.  The solution that the\nthose ground control folks came up with?  Go out there with some grease\nand some wipes to clean it up and grease it up.  No sweat.</p>\n<p>Looking into her airlock bag with these advanced tools she sees something\nvery concerning.  “I think we had a grease gun explode in the large bag.\nThere’s grease in the bag.”</p>\n<p>She heard Steve Bown observe dryly over her headset, “Ah. it must have been\nthe pressure changes.”  Putting that MIT engineering degree to work.</p>\n<p>The flight controllers peered through her helmet camera uplink and calmly\nassessed the situation, with suggestions.  She grabbed a dry wipe and did her\nbest to clean up the grease.  The EVA suit’s not known for being dextrous,\nthough, and one movement too exxagerated knocked the bag.  It tumbled away,\noff on its own.  Out of reach.</p>\n<p>“Oh, great. We have a lost tool, uh, I guess one of my crew lock bags was not\ntransferred and it’s loose.”</p>\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts126/081118fd5/index2.html\">how one more piece of space debris</a> ended up in orbit.  There are\n<a href=\"https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/faq/#faq03\">more than 23,000 pieces of debris larger than 10cm in orbit</a>.  This number\ngrows every day.  Even something as small as Heide’s tool bag can be identified\nand <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJF8m0KbDZQ\">seen from the ground</a>.</p>\n<p>Space debris becomes more and more of a concern as we look outwards from our\nown planet.  This is a problem known as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kessler_syndrome\">Kessler syndrom</a>.  The thought is\nthat a time could come where there’s such a density of space debris that\nwe avoiding collision would be impossible.  Even in the early 2000s we found\n<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20001121234600/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/planetearth/space_junk_000901.html\">evidence of small debris embedding itself in shuttle windows</a>.</p>\n<p>An impact with a piece of space debris is on average a collision with the\nrelative difference in velocity of 10-15km/s.  This is 10x the speed of even\nthe fastest bullets.  At that speed, even a bolt no bigger than your thumb will\ntear through steel like paper.</p>\n<p>There’s many <a href=\"http://stuffin.space/\">projects to track and visualize space debris</a>, but what do we\ndo to make this better?</p>\n<p>One approach is to stop putting things in higher orbits.  Low earth orbit has\na small amount of atmosphere which causes drag on items.  This means that,\nwithout assistance, items in low earth orbit will leave orbit and return\nto earth.  This is great because it puts a much shorter time limit on debris:\nyears instead of millenia.  This is why Starlink is considered less of a\nnegative impact on space debris.</p>\n<p>However, that still leaves thousands of tons of space junk in higher orbit.\nSome of these will take many, many lifetimes before they would deorbit on their\nown - perhaps longer.  Actively removing these takes ingenuity.  Science\nfiction has looked into this active removal via <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/video/vi1534902553\">movies</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planetes\">comics</a>.</p>\n<p>In reality, it’s more likely that we’ll use ground-based or sattelite-based\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_broom\">Laser Brooms</a> to control and deorbit smaller debris (1cm-10cm in size).\nThis works by targeting a piece of debris and firing a high-power laser to heat\none side of the debris to produce thrust.  This would make the orbit unstable,\nquickening the eventual deorbit.</p>\n<p>Oh, and Heide’s toolbag.  It was in a low orbit on its own around Earth until\nit lost enough velocity to return on August 3, 2009.  It was vaporized\nduring reentry.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-14"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/14","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/aOPINgmqpVXNK/giphy.gif\"></p>\n<p>Another Google product is being put out to pasture.

So the\nRule of Cool can be used as a fantastic reward to those wonderful players.</p>\n<p>My favorite rule of cool I’d been part of was when an Orc fighter, Human Druid,\nan Elven Cleric, and a Gnome Barbarian were in dire straits.  They’d been a\nBig Bad Evil Wizard for an hour - and had nearly taken them down.  Right\nas they were going to strike the final blow, the wizard had opened a magical\nportal (Dimension Door) towards their friend and compatriot, the Elven Cleric.</p>\n<p>He’d knocked them unconcious with a magic weapon attack, and the cleric\nwas barely holding onto their mortal coil.  None of the three had enough time\nto get over the difficult terrain to the Big Bad to save their friend.  A\nfriend that they’d gotten close with over months.

The utilidor has pneumatic tubes to quickly\nwhisk away any and all trash away from the park - to where it can be\ndisposed of or recycled.  This helps the custodial staff keep the park as\nclean as it is - by taking all the trash and dumping it somewhere else.</p>\n<p>There are “Backstage” tours of Walt Disney World that show off the utilidor\namong other ways that the magic is preserved at the theme park.

This has been ongoing since August 2010.</p>\n<p>TLDR: It’s fair use, the declaring code is very small and is not\nimplementation, but instead a general organization. As such, it’s fair use.</p>\n<p>Let’s read a couple excerpts!</p>\n<p>The most succinct description of how this is fair use:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google copied these lines not because of their creativity or beauty but\nbecause they would allow programmers to bring their skills to a new\nsmartphone computing environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But does this mean that programs in general are not copyrightable?\nThe following decides that’s not the case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As part of an interface, the copied lines are inherently\nbound together with uncopyrightable ideas (the overall organization of\nthe API) and the creation of new creative expression (the code inde-\npendently written by Google). Unlike many other computer programs,\nthe value of the copied lines is in significant part derived from the in-\nvestment of users (here computer programmers) who have learned the\nAPI’s system. Given these differences, application of fair use here is\nunlikely to undermine the general copyright protection that Congress\nprovided for computer programs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How much of the code is considered copied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one considers the declaring code in isolation, the quan-\ntitative amount of what Google copied was large. Google\ncopied the declaring code for 37 packages of the Sun Java\nAPI, totaling approximately 11,500 lines of code. Those\nlines of code amount to virtually all the declaring code\nneeded to call up hundreds of different tasks. On the other\nhand, if one considers the entire set of software material in\nthe Sun Java API, the quantitative amount copied was\nsmall. The total set of Sun Java API computer code, includ-\ning implementing code, amounted to 2.86 million lines, of\nwhich the copied 11,500 lines were only 0.4 percent</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, my favorite part of the entire decision is that they retell one of\nthe world’s shortest short stories:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.</p>\n</blockquote>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-05"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/05","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/hsxg9x2LrmTNC/giphy.gif\"></p>\n<p>There’s a really neat <a href=\"https://retrocomputing.stackexchange.com/questions/13897/why-was-the-kickstart-1-x-insert-floppy-graphic-so-bad/13901\">stack overflow post</a> about the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AmigaOS\">Amiga OS</a> Kickstart image.

This can be squarely blamed\non a more sedentary lifestyle than is ideal.  This doesn’t mean I can’t.\nWe’re all <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IxuThNgl3YA\">Born to Run</a> in our own ways.  Some hypotheses even suggest that\nwe should take that pretty literally.</p>\n<p>For example, look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rar%C3%A1muri\">Rarámuri</a> peoples - 5KM might feel like a lot,\nbut they’re known to long-distance running.  Extremely long-distance running.\nUp to 320KM in one session, often over the course of multiple days.  That isn’t\neven on flat surfaces, either.  It’s through canyon and brush, with rather\nsignificant elevation changes and rough terrain.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the Rarámuri also have competitive aspects to their running,\nsuch as the game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rarajipari\">Rarajipari</a> - a game of kicking and chasing a ball.  Even\ncasual games will go on for several miles.  However, after some serious\nall-night partying they will do equally serious matches which go on for thirty\nto fourty miles.</p>\n<p>While much of that can seem extreme, it’s led many to lean into the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_running_hypothesis\">Endurance running hypothesis</a> - that certain human characteristics can be\nexplained by our need to run extended distances.  Sure, it’s just a hypothesis,\nand there’s definitely some areas where it falters - but it’s interesting\nnonetheless.</p>\n<p>For example - we have shorter toes than other primates.  For grasping, this\nmakes us greatly inferior.  We lost overall strength and gripping capabilities.\nWith such short toes, how am I supposed to hang from the monkey bars with just\nmy toes?  However, shorter toes mean less mechanical work is needed to support\nweight.  Less exertion is put on the joints, and we can support 75% of our body\nweight on just our toes.  In running, this is incredibly important - as we often\nwill end up landing on our toes - and those longer toes would cause injuries.</p>\n<p>What does it all mean, though?  Well, you might not run 300KM in a single go\ntoday - but I’m sure 5KM is a good start on it.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-01"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/01","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/Sw5EsuT5VI3aU/giphy.gif\"></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MikaelThalen/status/1376653334396903428\">;l;;gmlxzssaw</a></p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-30"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/03/30","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/LqW9dLVjQm3cs/giphy.gif\"></p>\n<p>The Suez canal is clear again.</p>\n<p>Hackernews was suggesting a wide array of possible solutions.</p>\n<p>You can vibrate the sand with the right resonance to “liquefy” the sand\nallowing for easier passage - similar <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV4sTbpa7Hc\">to concrete</a>.</p>\n<p>You can use heavy-lift helicopters to unload the shipping containers\nto.. somewhere.

Originally brought\nto Ireland in the 12th century via the Norman Invasion, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_conquest_of_Ireland\">Tudor conquest</a>\nled to English speaking immigrants flooding Ireland, and a general suppresion of\nthe Irish language.  More recently, <a href=\"https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/ilg/\">only 4% of surveyed Irish speakers</a>\nspeak Gaelige in their daily life.  Otherwise, English is the predominant language\nof the land.</p>\n<p>While the English attempted suppress anything other than the traditional\nEnglish at the time, there’s been a number of differences that have grown to\nmake Irish English unique across the gamut - grammar, vocabulary, and phonetics,\nMuch of this is holdover from Gaelige, which makes it doubly interesting.</p>\n<p>One particularly interesting grammatical difference is that “yes” and “no” are\nfar less frequently used.  For example, “You speak with an Irish dialect?” would\nbe responded with “I do” instead of “Yes”.  Much of this is due to\nthe Irish language lacking “yes” or “no” as vocabulary.  Instead,\nthe verb is negated and responded with.</p>\n<p>Hiberno-English pulls a number of words from Gaeilge as loan-words, as well\nas some that are merely derived from the national language.  “Sláinte!” is\none that you might hear in a pub, meaning “(To your) Health!”  And if you’re\nnervous, you might “fooster” - to fidget - derived from the Gaeilge word\n“Fústar”.  In other cases, Hiberno-English has vocabulary that is less\nclearly historied - such as when you’ve really broken something?  It’s\n“banjaxed”.</p>\n<p>The phonology of Hiberno-English is probably what differs the most between\nthe regions.  I’ll be frank - I’m not a phonetics expert, and <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/84678944.pdf\">every paper</a>\nI’ve read on this really goes all out on that.

Let’s take Venmo as an example.\nVenmo embeds Plaid’s SDK.  A user will want to link their bank account to\nVenmo.  The SDK interacts with and then Plaid performs a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">Man in the Middle</a> attack on the end-user.  Within an app (not the bank’s)\napp, Plaid’s embeddable code will simulate a fake bank login, collect\ncredentials - including many 2FA - and then falsify a login as if they were\nan end user.  At this point they scrape all data they can get access to,\nstoring it all in their servers.  This is how their customers, like Venmo,\nwould be able to verify you own your account and can peek at your account\nbalance to verify you have funds to pay for that\n<a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86907/here-are-most-popular-transactions-made-through-venmo\">pizza / rent / drugs / fantasy football</a>.</p>\n<p>Plaid’s codebase itself has a distinct issue, too.  The underlying code for\ntheir scrapers are thousands upon thousands of Python files that connect\ntogether like spaghetti.  Updates get patched in at random, so following\nsecurity practices is attempted but… it’s a moving target.</p>\n<p>As far as permissioning - it’s nonexistent.  Plaid gives every single one of\ntheir customers full access to the accounts of users that authenticated.\nWith Venmo - account verification?  Sure!  Account balance?  Uh.. weird, but\nokay.  Loan status?  Credit card statements?  Transactions unrelated to Venmo?\nIdentity documentation?  Initiate transfers? <a href=\"https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#accountsget\">Uhh.. Why?!

Best\nguess was a reset after Mirantis acquired part of the company?</p>\n<p>What’s Docker the software?  Let’s start with the basics.</p>\n<p>Containers.  Containers are effectively packaging to create a running process\nwith encapsulation features applied to keep it isolated from when\nrunning on a host computer.  Containers as a concept have been around for\ndecades - older examples would be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVZ\">OpenVZ</a>.</p>\n<p>Containers are helpful for developing software because they provide portability,\nreproducibility, and isolation.  Portability helps you run your app anywhere -\nirregardless of the system you’re running on.  Isolation is so that state in\nthe host and state in other Containers won’t impact your app.</p>\n<p>This is different from virtual machines that have full virtualization.\nContainers will often utilize OS virtualization &#x26; isolation features to\nshare multiple containers safely in one OS - instead of a full VM where the\nOS is duplicated.</p>\n<p>That leads to Docker the Software.  Docker the software brings container\ntooling, an abstraction layer wrapping multiple Virtualization APIs, and a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language\">Domain Specific Language</a> for Container Filesystems.</p>\n<p>Docker’s “images” include everything needed to start a container - the code or\nbinary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.\nDocker images and containers are supported by most of the big cloud providers -\nAMZN AWS, GOOG Cloud, MSFT Azure, Heroku, Glitch, and others.  The same docker\nimage can be run across all of them.</p>\n<p>But what does Docker Inc do?  Docker, Inc primarily develops Docker Hub and\nDocker Desktop at this point in time.  Per their <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/blog/helping-dev-teams-get-ship-done/\">blog post</a> about their\nplans for the funding it seems like they’re focusing on improving dev\nexperience, tooling around security, and API development.</p>\n<p>I’ve got high hopes for the company into the 2020s.  Here’s hoping that this\ntime investor interests are more closely aligned with the direction of the\ncompany.

In the mid-90s we stopped\nusing Halon because it is incredibly damaging to the ozone layer and\ncontributes considerably towards global warming.  However much damage\nit causes to the planet, it’s relatively safe for humans.  While Halon\nmay cause dizziness and tingling in the extremities at the low amounts\nit may be effective at, it is relatively safe to be used in close\nquarters.

Regional dialects are\nincredibly common!  Another well known regional dialect is the dialect from\nOsaka, Japan and the surrounding regions - commonly known as the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_dialect\">Kansai dialect, western Japanese, or “Kansai-ben”.</a></p>\n<p>Kansai-ben is usually characterized as being a bit harsher to the ears but\nmore melodic.  All of Kansai dialect has <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2718816\">an acestor in the Kinai dialect,</a>\nand was considered the national dialect of Japan while Kyoto was the capital.\nHowever, once the capital moved to Edo - now Tokyo - the dialect of that\nregion took hold on the country, now commonly known as Tokyo dialect or\nStandard Japanese.  However, using the Kansai dialect is often\n<a href=\"https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000001-I000000007089-00\">a source of pride to people from Kansai</a>, with many being rather attached\nto it.</p>\n<p>Kansai-ben used to be the stereotypical villain but now it’s more commonly\nassociated with boisterous personalities in Japanese pop-culture.  Because of\nthe shared regional origins, the Kansai-ben is often associated with a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai\">Manzai</a> comedy.  Manzai is a type of traditional Japanese stand-up comedy\nbased around a funny man (Tsukommi) and a straight man (Boke) - but more often\nthan not they’ll be speaking with a Kansai dialect.</p>\n<p>There are grammatical differences, different words, and a few other differences\nbetween Kansai dialect and Tokyo dialect.   The difference I think that’s\nthe most interesting is one that is often more difficult for English speakers:\nPitch Accent.  This is one of the quickest ways that non-Kansai dialect\nspeakers will identity Kansa dialect speakers. </p>\n<p>I’m not an expert in pitch accent - far from it.  If you’re interested in\nlearning more about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6AoilGEers\">Pitch Accent, Dogen has a wonderful 10 minute video</a>\nbut the trick to Standard Japanese intonation is to\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0ULPlBeKzg\">just say it flat.  Right?</a></p>\n<p>Now it’s time for me to butcher an example.  Let’s take “Japan” - <code class=\"language-text\">ni-ho-n</code>.\nIt has 3 mora - which isn’t quite a syllable but.. close enough.  For Tokyo\ndialect, this starts out low pitch, raises, the lowers again.  This is called\nthe nakadaka (中高) pattern.  For Kansai dialect, though, we start the pitch\nhigh, then are low for rest of the word - known as the atamadaka (頭高) pattern.</p>\n<p>Of course, the most important thing you need to know when about Kansai-ben when\nvisiting Osaka?</p>\n<p>When asked:\n「儲かりまっかぁ？」 (Mokari makka?)</p>\n<p>Respond with:\n「ぼちぼちでんなぁー。たこ焼きとビールが必要や。」 (Bochi bochi, denna.

Of this, Scheel noted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am less intrigued by the differences and more interested in our\nsimilarities.

As such, the\nexpressions of intelligence they have could just be poorly understood by us.\nJust because we excel in a larger number of areas on average doesn’t mean that\nsome animals can do better than some people in specific tasks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=191810&#x26;cid=15757347\">From Slashdot</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Back in the 1980s, Yosemite National Park was having a serious problem\nwith bears: They would wander into campgrounds and break into the garbage\nbins.</p>\n<p>This put both bears and people at risk. So the Park Service started\ninstalling armored garbage cans that were tricky to open — you had to\nswing a latch, align two bits of handle, that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>But it turns out it’s actually quite tricky to get the design of these cans\njust right. Make it too complex and people can’t get them open to put away\ntheir garbage in the first place.</p>\n<p>Said one park ranger, “There is considerable overlap between the intelligence\nof the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps the entire marshmallow test is flawed.

It’s not worth\nunpacking all of that.  It really isn’t.  I promise you.</p>\n<p>Instead, let’s chat about how this happened.  It’s pretty simple.</p>\n<p>The site in question had <a href=\"https://archive.vn/oxbck\">a commit</a> from the Gab CTO which migrated a\nspecific SQL query away from the library abstraction SQL and into raw SQL -\nthe query language used to interact more directly with their database.\nThis is often done because a custom SQL query can often be used to greatly\nimprove performance.</p>\n<p>However…</p>\n<p>As part of this, they used string interpolation do craft the query.  String\ninterpolation is kinda like saying <code class=\"language-text\">VARIABLE_U</code> is <code class=\"language-text\">james</code> and I want to\ninterpolate that into <code class=\"language-text\">SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = &#39;$VARIABLE_U&#39;</code> so\nthat I end up with the final string of <code class=\"language-text\">SELECT * FROM WHERE username = &#39;james&#39;</code>.</p>\n<p>Simple, right?</p>\n<p>This way of crafting SQL can fail because of what is known as\n<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection\">SQL Injection</a>. In our example, what if <code class=\"language-text\">VARIABLE_U</code> was coming from an\ninput field on a website?  In that case, a user could type whatever they wanted\ninto that field.</p>\n<p>If a user was to type in <code class=\"language-text\">&#39; OR &#39;a&#39; = &#39;a</code>, the final string would then look\nsomething like <code class=\"language-text\">SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = &#39;&#39; OR &#39;a&#39; = &#39;a&#39;</code>.\nInstead of limiting to a single <code class=\"language-text\">username</code> value, we’d instead retrieve any\nusers.</p>\n<p>This can be elaborated on to do even more - such as with\n<a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_SQL_Injection\">Blind SQL Injection</a> techniques.</p>\n<p>How should they instead of handled this?  By using the library to “bind”\nparameters.  <a href=\"https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Querying.html#method-i-find_by_sql\">Ruby on Rails</a> supports this in the function used by the\nchange that caused the breach.</p>\n<p>In our example, we could instead write the query as\n<code class=\"language-text\">SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = ?</code> and then tell the library to bind\n<code class=\"language-text\">VARIABLE_U</code> to the first numbered parameter.  No string interpolation would\nbe performed, and with most databases the query would be sent over completely\nseparate from the bound parameters!</p>\n<p>This should have been caught in code review.

It’s not just\nan indicator of your originating geography but also the cultural upbringing\nyou had.  Over the next few weeks I’ll be picking out a few different\nlanguage dialects to both learn about and write about.</p>\n<p>To start with, a dialect that’s near and dear to me: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appalachian_English\">Appalachian English</a>,\nalso known as Smoky Mountain English or Southern Mountain English.  This is\nthe dialect that’s most often attributed to the inland Southern United States\nand has many features of 18th-century colonial English.  I’d often encounter\nthis dialect with my family in Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Viriginia.</p>\n<p>Some of the words I’ve picked up over time that I can think of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">afeared</code> - to be afraid</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">buggy</code> - a shopping cart</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">britches</code> - pants</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">crick</code> - this may be either a stiffness of joints in the body or a creek</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">fixin</code> - this can also be a few things - either to say something is soon to\nhappen, or a portion of food</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">holler</code> - the steep valley between two hills, because you can “holler”\nacross to the other side</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">plumb</code> - completely</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">reckon</code> - suppose</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">skifting</code> - a dusting, usually of snow on the ground</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">sody-pop</code> - carbonated beverages</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">spell</code> - either a duration of time or the state of being lightheaded</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">yonder</code> - somewhere distant, away from where we are currently</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Appalachian English has many other archaic phrases, words, and prefixes.<br>\nMost of the above fall into that - either from older English words like\n<code class=\"language-text\">breetches</code> or the <code class=\"language-text\">a-</code> (such as <code class=\"language-text\">afeared</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">a-haunted</code>) prefix which comes\nfrom Early Middle English.  <code class=\"language-text\">right</code> can also be used with adjectives and\nadverbs such as <code class=\"language-text\">right fine</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">right quick</code>.</p>\n<p>Southern drawl is also an important aspect of this dialect.  Sourthern Drawl -\nconsidered <a href=\"http://dialectblog.com/2011/04/20/twangs-vs-drawls/\">different from the Southern twang</a> - is a common\npattern in how the vowels are prolonged making the speech sound slower.\nTo many, this leads to the incorrect assumption that\nan individual with a drawl is <a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/why-does-a-southern-drawl-sound-uneducated-to-some/\">uneducated or dim-witted</a>.\nPart of this is from a lack of exposure to Southern accents - people that\ndon’t hear it can immediately hear the other-ness.  However, even people that\ngrow up with the accent are told that a Southern accent is “wrong” via\npop-culture and media.  How many celebrities speak with a Southern drawl?</p>\n<p>Dialects like this might sound strange to people that aren’t part of them.\nHowever, to those that are within that dialect outsiders without it sound\nforeign.  To quote my cousins in regards to my differing dialect,\n“Yew talk real funny!  Y’all spake all fast-like.

The Videocassette Recorder was\nfeared by the television industry and heralded by consumers.\nA new way to consume movies and television was born with the VHS.</p>\n<p>There was one issue with translating theatrical movies to the small screen:\nHome televisions were 4:3 aspect ratio.  This meant that the the screens had\na width of 1.33 times the height unlike the new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinemaScope\">Cinemascope</a> and other\nWidescreen formats for theatrical releases that became popular after 1960.</p>\n<p>Two techniques are available to make the widescreen theatrical releases\nfit on a smaller screen.  There’s always letterboxing - which adds black bars\nabove and below the screen.  Another technique is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_and_scan\">Pan and Scan</a> - where\nthe image is translated to better show off the points of interest in the\ncinematography, shaping the film to match the 4:3 through cropping or other\ntechniques.  This would be done by an editor and could drastically change\nthe tone of a scene if done poorly.  This is why many criticize and refuse\nto release a pan and scan version.</p>\n<p>The kind of film that would do well in the “home cinema” also differed\nfrom what would do well in the theater. </p>\n<p>In the the theater there is less need to keep the audience’s attention -\nthey were stuck there in the building.  At home, you have distractions so a\ndifferent kind of movie can prosper.  Comedy movies like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallrats\">Mallrats</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski\">The Big Lebowski</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space\">Office Space</a> did ABYSMALLY in the theater but\nfound their footing once they were released on VHS.  Some of this is\nattributed to the fact that they can be enjoyed more recreationally and\nsporadically than many other movies that require direct attention.</p>\n<p>The Horror film genre <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(1982_film)\">The Thing</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abyss\">The Abyss</a>, and “slasher” movies like\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_(1978_film)\">Halloween</a> did extraorgdinarily well on VHS.  This could because.. what’s\nscarier than when the monster is.. inside your own house?  On the small screen\nit’s harder to see what’s going on but sometimes that adds to the fear.. plus,\nyou can’t see the zipper so easily on the scary demon monster.</p>\n<p>There’s also some films that wouldn’t be as popular today if it weren’t for\nhome video - such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film)\">Labyrinth</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner\">Blade Runner</a>,\nor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trouble_in_Little_China\">Big Trouble in Little China</a>.

They assess\nrisk, carefully mitigate failure, and aim for predictable outcomes.</p>\n<p>Volatiles will show up, stomp on everything that exists, and leave a trail\nof disruption in their wake.  However, when they build.. they sure build a LOT.\nIn some cases, what they make will be novel and would not have occurred\notherwise.</p>\n<p>Stables and Volatiles are at odds with one another.  They do not get along\non everything but a team with both can be incredibly successful - even if\nthere’s a bit of conflict along the way.  Volatiles become stables,\nand sometime stables become volatiles, and neither is really good or bad.\nThey just <em>are</em>.</p>\n<p>These archetypes are applicable to the argument about boring versus exciting\ntechnology.  Stables will more likely than not choose the familiar.\nVolatiles will sometimes choose the foreign.  Neither is right or wrong -\nat least not intrinsically.

The mission is one of the most ambitious\nwe’ve sent to the red planet - but not just because of the rover\n(which, itself, is the most complex and featured rover we’ve sent).</p>\n<p>The EDL (Entry, Descent, and Landing) platform was also for more advanced\nthan any other we’d sent - with the descent into the Martian atmosphere\nbeing yet another part of the experiment.  The ablative heat shielding\ncovered the bottom of the capsule - with a type of plating covering it\nwhich upon heating would vaporize and be carried away from the\nPerseverance capsule.</p>\n<p>The Perseverance also carried 661lbs of tungsten weights.  However, just\nbecause they’re dead weight doesn’t mean they won’t serve a purpose.</p>\n<p>Two 165 pound blocks of tungsten kept Perseverance in a stable and balanced\nspin on its journey from Earth.  This prevented any one side of the capsule\nfrom getting too hot.  These are jettisoned 900 miles or so above Mars as\nthey’d no longer be needed.  Waste not, though.  These two tungsten blocks\nwill slam into the surface of Mars at 9,000 mph or so and is\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/science/nasa-mars-landing.html\">part of a very vital experiment</a>.  The InSight lander has a\nseismometer and even at 2000 miles away it’ll be listening for Perseverance\nknocking with these tungsten payloads.</p>\n<p>Removing those two tungsten blocks is an important part of the entry phase\nbecause while balance is required during the journey, the entry requires\ndebalancing.  Because one side of the capsule is heavier than the other\nthe entry angle will be at 16°.  This leads to a slight amount of lift\nexperienced by the craft, allowing the descent to be controlled via\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system\">RCS (Reaction Control System)</a> powered rotation - rotate left to\ncause the lift to push you one way, right to push the other, and go left\nand right consistently to burn off speed.  This is all autonomous!</p>\n<p>There’s also six 55lb tungsten masses that ensure landing is aligned.\nThese are jettisoned right before firing the parachute and are used to\nensure that the radar will be oriented in the correct direction.  While\nthe RCS was fired roughly 2,256 times during atmosphere entry, at this point\nthey aren’t a whole lot of use.  These tungsten blocks are jettisoned two at\na time, and will cause the craft to roll into the exact orientation needed\nfor the rest of the descent.</p>\n<p>Haven’t heard yet if InSight heard Perseverance’s hello to start a welcome\nparty, but all of this was fantastically interesting to me and I’m always\nsurprised at how much NASA can achieve.</p>\n<p>Wanna watch it?  <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/919215638\">They streamed the landing on twitch!</a>\nWhat an amazing future we live in.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-19"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/19","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>\n            <img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/cVWZ8dVs5VOEvdhH1M/giphy.gif' alt='null' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<p>In 2019, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/28-05-2019-burn-out-an-occupational-phenomenon-international-classification-of-diseases\">recognized burnout as an occupational phenomenon in the ICD-11</a>.\nHowever, a relatively new <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/02/beyond-burned-out\">article by HBR about burnout points at studies</a> that show the pandemic has\nbeen causing burnout to run rampant since early 2020.  “Knowledge workers” are now mostly working remotely -\nlooking at Zoom, for example, they went from 10 million to 200 million active users effectively overnight.</p>\n<p>To clarify: Burnout is really just another term for chronic stress causing emotional, mental, and even physical damage.</p>\n<p>Lots of companies just look at it as a personal problem.

A push to deregulate even more was in the late 90s and\nmuch of ERCOT is powered by an aging and neglected coal and natural gas\ninfrastructure.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen a number of talking points saying that this is all because renewable\nenergy such as wind and solar are failing Texas - which isn’t the case.\nNot only do modern wind turbines handle ice and snow through\n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/02/16/why-wind-turbines-in-cold-climates-dont-freeze-de-icing-and-carbon-fiber/\">some neat mechanisms</a>, most of the 80% power deficit has to do with the\n[natural gas, coal, and nuclear losing capacity]23.  Natural gas pipelines froze, coal\ncouldn’t be shipped, and nuclear plants did not have the abilities to\nprevent the cooling water reservoirs from potentially freezing.</p>\n<p>This all ends up hurting the citizens of Texas - where rolling power outages\nturning into several day outages as ERCOT scrambles to make up for the\nshortages.  Folks are cold, hungry, and don’t have water.</p>\n<p>It’s a bad situation.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-17"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/17","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p><img src=\"https://media.giphy.com/media/LcfBYS8BKhCvK/giphy.gif\"></p>\n<p>Have you ever wanted to make an interface for a program, but\nrealized web just isn’t for you?

Blessed is a\nJavascript library to create CLIs, but you’ll notice that the react API\nit has is really game changing.  Using a special <code class=\"language-text\">blessed</code> renderer in React\nyou can create CLI interfaces with the same paradigms as any React 16\napplication.  Combine that with the contrib package and you can have real\ntime terminal dashboards that show graphs, maps, spark lines, markdown,\nand even picture rendering.</p>\n<p>It’s one thing to show off your cool new graphical web app.  It’s another\nentirely to show off your 100% hacker terminal app.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-16"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/16","time":"00:00 UTC","title":null}}},{"node":{"html":"<p>\n            <img src='https://media.giphy.com/media/3oriNYQX2lC6dfW2Ji/giphy.gif' alt='null' loading='lazy' />\n          </p>\n<p>In Javascript, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variadic_function\">functions always have variadic arguments</a>.

They work through the arguments array backwards\nso they don’t really need to know how many arguments are in the stack,\nbut they can assume that there’s at least the enough arguments to\nsatisfy the parameter count - even if the arguments are <code class=\"language-text\">undefined</code>.\nThis allows for cutting up the formal parameters and the extra variadic\narguments to pass them to the callee frame in a way that doesn’t require\nextra lookups or an extra frame that will calculate it all.</p>\n<p>No more overhead!
