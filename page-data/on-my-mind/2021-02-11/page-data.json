It’s a way of peering through time and culture to see\nhow different people live and have lived.</p>\n<p>Those of us that still have stable incomes can often find far more ingredients\nthan ever before.  In New York City there’s <a href=\"https://chefcollectivenyc.com/\">Chef Collective</a> seeing even better\nstock because many restaurants have shuttered or are generally seeing fewer\ncustomers.  Some restaurants, like <a href=\"https://www.xianfoods.com/\">Xi’an Famous Foods</a>, have even pivoted to\nselling “kits” instead of doing delivery because their foods don’t work well\nwith delivery.</p>\n<p>The article points out a book - <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Cook-Wolf-M-F-K-Fisher/dp/0865473366/\">How to Cook a Wolf by MFK Fisher</a>.  The book\nthrough dealing with shortages and difficulties that existed when cooking during\nWorld War 2.  I am so grateful that my life is in a place where the feeling\nof hunger is a choice rather than a fact of life.  I picked up a copy of the\nbook.  I’m really looking forward to reading it.</p>\n<p>In theory, I love to cook.  In practice, I’ve been cooking far too often to\ntruly enjoy it.  I have always had an extreme respect for my mother and father.\nWe cooked food at home every single day while I was growing up - sometimes\nout of necessity.  We didn’t do fast food, and we very rarely ate at\nrestaurants or had takeout.  They followed through with that to make sure\nthere was food on the table &#x26; dealt with getting children to eat that food.</p>\n<p>I really do love cooking - just.. in theory.  In practice, I can’t wait to\nmake it an exciting optional activity like this cooking class I’m taking.\nI’ve registered to the wait list for the vaccine and boy am I looking forward\nto that.</p>","excerpt":"There’s something about the fact that I’m taking an at-home class for cooking\nfrom a world-renowned french cuisine Chef that’s feeling like…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-11"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/11"}},"previous":null,"next":{"id":"3e1f7630-c347-5f7c-9072-5cd637c139b6","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-15"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/15"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-02-11","previous":null,"next":"/2021-02-15"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
