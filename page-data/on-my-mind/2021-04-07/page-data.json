At the end of the day, though,\nall of the rules can be blurred or broken.</p>\n<p>That’s why the Dungeon Master is always looked upon as a supreme being of\ngrand benevolence.  It’s also why there’s one rule that has withstood the test\nof time: The Rule… of Cool.</p>\n<p>It’s one of the first things you often get told when you ask a seasoned\nstoryteller for DnD for advice.  The Rule of Cool is simple, really.  If it’s\ncool?  Why not let it play out?  Of course, cool is subjective.</p>\n<p>Here’s the deal: You’re playing with friends.  You want your friends to all\nfeel like they are the most amazing people. (Spoiler: They are.)  So the\nRule of Cool can be used as a fantastic reward to those wonderful players.</p>\n<p>My favorite rule of cool I’d been part of was when an Orc fighter, Human Druid,\nan Elven Cleric, and a Gnome Barbarian were in dire straits.  They’d been a\nBig Bad Evil Wizard for an hour - and had nearly taken them down.  Right\nas they were going to strike the final blow, the wizard had opened a magical\nportal (Dimension Door) towards their friend and compatriot, the Elven Cleric.</p>\n<p>He’d knocked them unconcious with a magic weapon attack, and the cleric\nwas barely holding onto their mortal coil.  None of the three had enough time\nto get over the difficult terrain to the Big Bad to save their friend.  A\nfriend that they’d gotten close with over months. Someone they cared about.\nIn less than 6 seconds they knew it would be the end.</p>\n<p>Except… what if… So the Orc player stared straight at our DM and declared\ntheir next action.  “I’m going to do a fastball special.”  They were declaring\nthat they’d PICK UP the Gnome and throw them as hard as they could at the\nBig Bad.</p>\n<p>The DM’s eyebrow raised as they opened up their rulebook, looked a bit, and\nclosed it.  We all knew there was nothing in there about this.  It’s just not\npart of the rules.  We all knew what the answer would be.\n“I don’t think you can throw them quite that far.  That’s 90 feet.”  We were\nall a little slack jawed.  Our DM had always followed the rules to a T… up\nuntil now.</p>\n<p>Our druid’s eyes light up.  “GUST OF WIND!  I HAVE A TURN.  GUST OF WIND.”</p>\n<p>With a bit of contemplation, the DM sighed.  “Alright.”  Pointing at the Orc,\n“You roll strength.”  Pointing at the Druid, “You roll wisdom”.\nPointing at the Gnome, “You roll for an attack.”</p>\n<p>Strength, 19, plus 4.  “You see her muscles ripple, and our Gnomish friend\nfeels like there is an incredibly springboard under his feet.  Before he has\neven a moment to think through how awful this plan is, he’s rocketed into the\nair.”</p>\n<p>Wisdom, 16, plus 3.  “Druidic energy starts to emenate visibly from the staff,\nand all of you can hear a howling of wind through the trees picking up.\nWhile soaring through the air, the Gnome accelerates even faster - the wind\nscreaming by their ears.”</p>\n<p>Attack roll, natural 20.  The gnome barbarian stares at the die, worried that\nit might change if they don’t keep a close eye on it.  “The wizard’s eyes go\nwide, as he starts to utter an incantation - but not fast enough.  You feel a\nCRUNCH as you slam into his chest, axes flying from a mix of momentum and\nyour rage.  Your vision is blood red.  You can hear your own pulse pounding in\nyour ears.  Uhh.. you have brutal critical, don’t you.  He’s only got..”</p>\n<p>The DM looked up quietly from behind their cardboard DM screen, they stole\nMatt Mercer’s line, with a giant grin growing across their face.\n“How do you want to do this?”  We broke a lot of rules - but we all felt like\nheroes.</p>","excerpt":"Dungeons and Dragons, is first and foremost, a collaborative storytelling game.\nSure, there might be lots of numbers and mechanics to…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-07"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/07"}},"previous":{"id":"1f3e4291-a218-531c-af07-17c372e3d799","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-06"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/06"}},"next":{"id":"0b098b74-aa62-5b52-9542-e1a12627a828","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-08"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/08"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-04-07","previous":"/2021-04-06","next":"/2021-04-08"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
