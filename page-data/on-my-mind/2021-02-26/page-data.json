Water witching.  Water Divination.  I’m gonna spoil it for you:\nit’s hogwash.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing\">Dowsing</a> has been a pseudoscience employed since the 1500s, and it was\njust as useless then as it is now.  Traditionally the way it works is that\nyou take  a forked twig, hold it in front of you, and it’ll make small\nmovements towards what you’re trying to find.</p>\n<p>The small movements are said to be magnetic ion something something by\ndivinators.  Those small movements are known as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_phenomenon\">Ideomotor phenomenon</a>.\nIt’s where a mental image or a thought bring on a reflexive muscular action\noutside of conscious knowledge.  It’s the same effect that you’ll see with\nother “precognition-lite” techniques like Ouija boards, automatic writing, and\nfacilitated communication.  (Sorry if I’ve dunked on your preferred\npseudoscience, happy for you to tell me how I’m wrong.) </p>\n<p>It’s been tested again and again and show that it’s a whole bunch of baloney.\nWhile the <a href=\"https://www.scientificexploration.org/docs/9/jse_09_1_betz.pdf\">1990 study by Hans-Dieter Betz</a> concludes that it works,\nbut <a href=\"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Water-dowsing%3A-TheScheunen-experiments-Enright/a51593dc28ad8c03eb51c2eb6d9e1d0d7db19ed4\">statistical analysis by J. T. Enright in 1995</a> finds that\nout of 500 dowsers even the best of the best were about only 0.4% better than\nrandom chance which could be easily attributed to statistical fluctuation.\nThat’s the most POSITIVE study I can find on it; there’s countless others that\ncall out dowsing as completely fake. Algeria 1943, New Zealand 1948, Britain\n1959, the British Ministry of Defense did one in 1971 - the list goes on and\nevery single one of them show this as a complete farce.</p>\n<p>Even today, <a href=\"https://sallylepage.medium.com/in-2017-uk-water-companies-still-rely-on-magic-6eb62e036b02\">water dowsing is employed by ten out of the twelve</a>\nwater companies in the UK.  Dowsing is considered “tried-and-tested” methods\nof finding water by these companies, if\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stwater/status/932618829976481792\">Twitter is to be believed</a>.\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/YorkshireWater/status/932650378260307969\">Really.</a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE_651\">ADE 651</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GT200\">GT200</a> are modern versions of the dowsing rod being sold\nin military applications as late as 2011 and have been found just as effective\nas previous dowsing rods.  Read: They’re as good as random chance because\nthat’s all it is.  They say they can track drugs, bombs, ivory, and who knows\nwhat else.  What’s even more amazing is they’re purported to be powered by the\nuser’s static electricity and they have programmable cards that you have to pay\nextra for because of.. electrostatic magnetic ion … It’s a huge fake and by\n2010 companies of both swindled people out of millions and millions of dollars.\nThis includes the governments of the USA, <a href=\"https://archive.vn/20130505091113/http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/Bomb-detector-kit-boss-court-face-fraud-charges/story-16522530-detail/story.html\">United Kingdom</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/world/middleeast/04sensors.html\">Iraq</a>, <a href=\"https://archive.today/20130505142849/http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/paid-46-000-unfit-bomb-detectors-court-told/story-18482857-detail/story.html\">Lebanon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/1555810/man-jailed-over-fake-bomb-detector-fraud\">Thailand</a>, and <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110722224740/http://rotativo.com.mx/seguridad/con-detector-molecular-sedena-asegura-arsenal-y-dinero/24719/html/\">Mexico</a>.</p>\n<p>The creators of these devices are currently being litigated so thoroughly that\nthey’ll need a dowsing rod to find themselves out of the mess they’re in.</p>\n<p>Thing is - if you have other sensory cues, you use your mind, and with the\nobserver expectancy cognitive bias - dowsing really works!  At least, it works\nabout as well as me going out into that same field and rolling a D20.</p>","excerpt":"There are people that claim they can tell you where water is via a dowsing rod.\nWater finding.
