Propeller-driven craft or trains\noften were much slower and didn’t travel as far over between timezones to cause it.  Jet-driven airplanes\ntravel such great distances that our circadian rhythm is frequently disrupted - causing disorientation\nand stress.</p>\n<p>Traveling west is usually considered to be an easier shift than east.  This is because most humans circadian\nclock has an endogenous period that’s slightly greater than 24 hours, and it’s easier to expand that window\nthan to shrink it.  In most cases, the 6-9 hour shift East causes the most problems.</p>\n<p>There’s lots of “cures” for jet lag but in most it boils down to timing and sleep schedules.\nPush to go to bed at a reasonable bedtime in the target timezone.
