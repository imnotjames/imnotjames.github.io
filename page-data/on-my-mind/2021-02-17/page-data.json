Much of this was fueled by\na secessionist attitude many Texas lawmakers take, as well as a want to avoid\nfederal regulations.  A push to deregulate even more was in the late 90s and\nmuch of ERCOT is powered by an aging and neglected coal and natural gas\ninfrastructure.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen a number of talking points saying that this is all because renewable\nenergy such as wind and solar are failing Texas - which isn’t the case.\nNot only do modern wind turbines handle ice and snow through\n<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/02/16/why-wind-turbines-in-cold-climates-dont-freeze-de-icing-and-carbon-fiber/\">some neat mechanisms</a>, most of the 80% power deficit has to do with the\n[natural gas, coal, and nuclear losing capacity][23.  Natural gas pipelines froze, coal\ncouldn’t be shipped, and nuclear plants did not have the abilities to\nprevent the cooling water reservoirs from potentially freezing.</p>\n<p>This all ends up hurting the citizens of Texas - where rolling power outages\nturning into several day outages as ERCOT scrambles to make up for the\nshortages.
