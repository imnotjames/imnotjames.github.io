I think from a privacy standpoint\nit’s an interesting read.  Something they touched on, however, gave me that\nweird gut feeling…</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let’s imagine your bank let you sign in to 3rd party services in a similar\nmanner. How many people would click through on “Let ACME corp act on your\nbehalf on your Citibank Account”. I think most people would be super scared\nof permissions like that. Instead they’d want very specific permission\nlike, only permission to deposit money, or only permission to read the\nbalance, or only permission to read transactions, etc…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oh, you sweet summer child.  Oh, no, no, no.  It’s much worse when it comes\nto banking.</p>\n<p>Enter Plaid.</p>\n<p>You might know Plaid because their Visa acquisiton was <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/visa-and-plaid-abandon-merger-after-antitrust-division-s-suit-block\">recently blocked</a>.</p>\n<p>Plaid operates as an “in-between” for their customers to allow end-users\nto sign into banks - surfacing information about account numbers,\nrouting numbers, current balance, recent transactions, and other related\nbanking information.</p>\n<p>Cool, right?</p>\n<p>Well, let’s pull apart how that works.  Let’s take Venmo as an example.\nVenmo embeds Plaid’s SDK.  A user will want to link their bank account to\nVenmo.  The SDK interacts with and then Plaid performs a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">Man in the Middle</a> attack on the end-user.  Within an app (not the bank’s)\napp, Plaid’s embeddable code will simulate a fake bank login, collect\ncredentials - including many 2FA - and then falsify a login as if they were\nan end user.  At this point they scrape all data they can get access to,\nstoring it all in their servers.  This is how their customers, like Venmo,\nwould be able to verify you own your account and can peek at your account\nbalance to verify you have funds to pay for that\n<a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/86907/here-are-most-popular-transactions-made-through-venmo\">pizza / rent / drugs / fantasy football</a>.</p>\n<p>Plaid’s codebase itself has a distinct issue, too.  The underlying code for\ntheir scrapers are thousands upon thousands of Python files that connect\ntogether like spaghetti.  Updates get patched in at random, so following\nsecurity practices is attempted but… it’s a moving target.</p>\n<p>As far as permissioning - it’s nonexistent.  Plaid gives every single one of\ntheir customers full access to the accounts of users that authenticated.\nWith Venmo - account verification?  Sure!  Account balance?  Uh.. weird, but\nokay.  Loan status?  Credit card statements?  Transactions unrelated to Venmo?\nIdentity documentation?  Initiate transfers? <a href=\"https://plaid.com/docs/api/accounts/#accountsget\">Uhh.. Why?!  For anyone?!!</a></p>\n<p>Is this legal?  Well, <a href=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/lawsuit-against-plaid-heightens-focus-on-data-privacy-issues\">maybe</a>.  That doesn’t stop\n<a href=\"https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/td-bank-files-lawsuit-against-plaid-accusing-it-of-trying-to-dupe-consumers-1.5145326\">banks from suing Plaid</a>.  This is also not great for consumers because it\nopens up new vectors for threat actors to gain access to accounts and could\nvoid agreements banks have with their customers around fraud.</p>\n<p>Lots of financial services apps like Mint also work in this way.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry, though, at least we can use alternatives.  Like, I’ve heard of\n“Yodlee” to do this, right? <a href=\"https://www.thetrustedinsight.com/investment-news/yodlee-jumpshot-data-problems-impact-on-hedge-funds-other-data-providers-20200304832/\">Oh…</a></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, services like Plaid provide features that users want.</p>\n<p>Do I think plaid is a security nightmare?  <strong>Yes.</strong></p>\n<p>Can I think of a reasonable alternative for their features?  <strong>No.</strong></p>","excerpt":"Last year Gregg Tavares posted about Github’s permission model,\nfrustrated with how it blindly grants the ability to request data from users…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-17"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/03/17"}},"previous":{"id":"78d8c428-b87a-5d25-8d19-81007627259e","fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-16"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/03/16"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-03-17","previous":"/2021-03-16","next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
