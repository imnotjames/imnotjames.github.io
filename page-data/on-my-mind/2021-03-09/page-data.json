Regional dialects are\nincredibly common!  Another well known regional dialect is the dialect from\nOsaka, Japan and the surrounding regions - commonly known as the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansai_dialect\">Kansai dialect, western Japanese, or “Kansai-ben”.</a></p>\n<p>Kansai-ben is usually characterized as being a bit harsher to the ears but\nmore melodic.  All of Kansai dialect has <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2718816\">an acestor in the Kinai dialect,</a>\nand was considered the national dialect of Japan while Kyoto was the capital.\nHowever, once the capital moved to Edo - now Tokyo - the dialect of that\nregion took hold on the country, now commonly known as Tokyo dialect or\nStandard Japanese.  However, using the Kansai dialect is often\n<a href=\"https://ndlonline.ndl.go.jp/#!/detail/R300000001-I000000007089-00\">a source of pride to people from Kansai</a>, with many being rather attached\nto it.</p>\n<p>Kansai-ben used to be the stereotypical villain but now it’s more commonly\nassociated with boisterous personalities in Japanese pop-culture.  Because of\nthe shared regional origins, the Kansai-ben is often associated with a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manzai\">Manzai</a> comedy.  Manzai is a type of traditional Japanese stand-up comedy\nbased around a funny man (Tsukommi) and a straight man (Boke) - but more often\nthan not they’ll be speaking with a Kansai dialect.</p>\n<p>There are grammatical differences, different words, and a few other differences\nbetween Kansai dialect and Tokyo dialect.   The difference I think that’s\nthe most interesting is one that is often more difficult for English speakers:\nPitch Accent.  This is one of the quickest ways that non-Kansai dialect\nspeakers will identity Kansa dialect speakers.</p>\n<p>I’m not an expert in pitch accent - far from it.  If you’re interested in\nlearning more about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6AoilGEers\">Pitch Accent, Dogen has a wonderful 10 minute video</a>\nbut the trick to Standard Japanese intonation is to\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0ULPlBeKzg\">just say it flat.  Right?</a></p>\n<p>Now it’s time for me to butcher an example.  Let’s take “Japan” - <code class=\"language-text\">ni-ho-n</code>.\nIt has 3 mora - which isn’t quite a syllable but.. close enough.  For Tokyo\ndialect, this starts out low pitch, raises, the lowers again.  This is called\nthe nakadaka (中高) pattern.  For Kansai dialect, though, we start the pitch\nhigh, then are low for rest of the word - known as the atamadaka (頭高) pattern.</p>\n<p>Of course, the most important thing you need to know when about Kansai-ben when\nvisiting Osaka?</p>\n<p>When asked:\n「儲かりまっかぁ？」 (Mokari makka?)</p>\n<p>Respond with:\n「ぼちぼちでんなぁー。たこ焼きとビールが必要や。」 (Bochi bochi, denna. Takoyaki to biru ga hitsuyoya.)</p>","excerpt":"Last week I wrote about an American English dialect.  Regional dialects are\nincredibly common!
