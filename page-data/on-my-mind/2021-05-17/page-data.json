One thing MTA has been working on has been\nimproving the signals they use for maintaining traings.  Over the past five years the MTA\nhas been replacing the existing infrastructure with newer digitized versions.\nSome of these signals were a century old.  Because of this, trains can safely increase speeds!</p>\n<p>If you take the R line in the city, for instance, trains have sped up 15mph all the way\nto 50MPH in some areas!  Even dangerous areas like near the Brooklyn-Bridge/City Hall station\nthey were able to increase speeds because of this.</p>\n<p>Some of this has also allowed for new kinds of data to be recorded.  Many of these points help\nwith logistics and planning for maintenance work and train routes.  However, others\nenable <a href=\"https://map.mta.info/\">things like the really cool live MTA map</a> that shows where trains are in\nreal time along the routes!</p>","excerpt":"Sometimes new technology and transit goes haywire, as seen earlier this morning when\na reboot caused turnstiles to lock up and prevent entry…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-05-17"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/05/17"}},"previous":{"id":"32260c7a-9596-52c8-924d-ca2f7b14f1e4","fields":{"slug":"/2021-05-12"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/05/12"}},"next":{"id":"5bc085a6-9f41-54f1-bd43-bafa046f087b","fields":{"slug":"/2021-05-18"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/05/18"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-05-17","previous":"/2021-05-12","next":"/2021-05-18"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
