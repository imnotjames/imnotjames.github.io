There’s a number of ways this is approached,\nsuch as the shabbat mode in a few different devices, or other means.</p>\n<p>Elevators have a shabbat mode.  They will often pick up from the 1st floor, go to\nthe top floor, and then stop on every floor.  That way, you don’t operate the\nelectric device and thus can properly observe.</p>\n<p>Ovens often will have a shabbat mode, too.  Some you set a cook time and desired\ntemperature and then it’ll randomly turn on at some point in the near future,\ncompletely out of your control.  Sort of.  Others will keep the oven\ncontinuously running at a specific low temperature all day.  As long as you\narne’t creating new “fire” then maybe it’s fine?</p>\n<p>There’s the eruv wires that mark a territory as “private”.  This means during\nShabbat you can carry objects within these designated areas.  One such eruv\nencircles all of Manhattan.  All of it.  Every week it’s inspected\nand a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ManhattanEruv\">status report is given on twitter</a>.</p>\n<p>But hey, don’t trust me on this.  Ask Rabbi instead.</p>","excerpt":"Observance of Shabbat seems to be very tricky to accomplish in our modern\nage of technical advancement.
