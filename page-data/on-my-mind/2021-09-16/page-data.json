This process is when we’re most susceptible to\nhaving our memories “rewritten” natrually, <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/partial-recall\">as described by Daniella Schiller.</a>\nIt’s possible that search engines have become ubiquitous in our lives\nas a transactive memory partner - we receive information and then quickly\nre-remember the information as being our own.</p>\n<p>This isn’t new to the internet, though.
