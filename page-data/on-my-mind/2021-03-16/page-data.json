Well, maybe.  In 2015, Docker\n<a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2015/04/14/docker-raises-95m-led-by-insight-venture-partners/\">had announced a $95M Series D raise of funding at a $1B valuation</a>.  Best\nguess was a reset after Mirantis acquired part of the company?</p>\n<p>What’s Docker the software?  Let’s start with the basics.</p>\n<p>Containers.  Containers are effectively packaging to create a running process\nwith encapsulation features applied to keep it isolated from when\nrunning on a host computer.  Containers as a concept have been around for\ndecades - older examples would be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVZ\">OpenVZ</a>.</p>\n<p>Containers are helpful for developing software because they provide portability,\nreproducibility, and isolation.  Portability helps you run your app anywhere -\nirregardless of the system you’re running on.  Isolation is so that state in\nthe host and state in other Containers won’t impact your app.</p>\n<p>This is different from virtual machines that have full virtualization.\nContainers will often utilize OS virtualization &#x26; isolation features to\nshare multiple containers safely in one OS - instead of a full VM where the\nOS is duplicated.</p>\n<p>That leads to Docker the Software.  Docker the software brings container\ntooling, an abstraction layer wrapping multiple Virtualization APIs, and a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language\">Domain Specific Language</a> for Container Filesystems.</p>\n<p>Docker’s “images” include everything needed to start a container - the code or\nbinary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.\nDocker images and containers are supported by most of the big cloud providers -\nAMZN AWS, GOOG Cloud, MSFT Azure, Heroku, Glitch, and others.  The same docker\nimage can be run across all of them.</p>\n<p>But what does Docker Inc do?  Docker, Inc primarily develops Docker Hub and\nDocker Desktop at this point in time.  Per their <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/blog/helping-dev-teams-get-ship-done/\">blog post</a> about their\nplans for the funding it seems like they’re focusing on improving dev\nexperience, tooling around security, and API development.</p>\n<p>I’ve got high hopes for the company into the 2020s.  Here’s hoping that this\ntime investor interests are more closely aligned with the direction of the\ncompany.  If not, I’m sure we’ll see Docker repeat the past decade again.</p>","excerpt":"Docker announced a Series B raise of $23M today - which is definitely impressive\nfor a company focused around Open-Source, right?
