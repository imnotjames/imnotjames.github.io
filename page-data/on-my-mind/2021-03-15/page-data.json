It’s a format,\nsimilar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard\">robots.txt</a> for making it clearer how to submit security\nissues to an organization.</p>\n<p>In theory, this is great!  It’s noted by <a href=\"https://cyber.dhs.gov/bod/20-01/\">the DHS</a> as a helpful way for\nresearchers to communicate their findings.  At one point, it was required\nfor agencies to have it, but was removed from that draft.   Because it’s at a\nnormalized location, it can be found by scraping sites like <a href=\"https://www.shodan.io/search?query=http.securitytxt%3Acontact\">SHODAN</a> and\n<a href=\"https://data.disclose.io/\">Disclose.io</a>.</p>\n<p>In practice, however, <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19152145\">some members of the cyber security community</a> find it\nto leads to a poor signal-to-noise ratio.  </p>\n<p>Some entrepeneurial members of the cybersecurity community will grab the\ndomain lists with <code class=\"language-text\">security.txt</code> files, fetch the email, run <a href=\"https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1639985\">burpsuite</a> or\n<a href=\"https://blog.rapid7.com/2011/12/08/six-ways-to-automate-metasploit/\">metasploit</a> to get some low effort security issues, and dump it all into\nexcel.  For extra credit, then do a <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/use-mail-merge-for-bulk-email-letters-labels-and-envelopes-f488ed5b-b849-4c11-9cff-932c49474705\">mail-merge</a>.  Minimal effort, and if\nyou get answers back you ask for a bug bounty.</p>\n<p>I don’t think that <code class=\"language-text\">security.txt</code> on its own will cause this, though.  It’s\njust as easy to search for Vulnerability Disclosure Policies and use those as\ninputs for automated security testing.  It takes a bit more manual work, but\neven with that you end up with odd security reports now and then.</p>\n<p>All of this is to explain how we ended up with the security report for a site\nthat shared the same first two letters of ours instead.</p>","excerpt":"Security.txt made the rounds again on HackerNews.
