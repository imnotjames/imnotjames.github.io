When looking at the word 森林浴 - “shinrin yoku”,\nI wanted to learn a bit more about these three words that make up the compound word.</p>\n<p>To start with, though, let’s look at another word: 木 - “ki”, or in english “tree”.\nIt’s 4 strokes and is a grade 1 / JLPTN4.  It’s taught in grade 1 of Japanese schools\nand is part of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test N4.  This one’s pretty simple!</p>\n<p>So, then 林… 木木, right?  This is “hayashi”, and could somewhat be translated to a\nsmall grove or woods.  Think a bunch of bushes, a few trees on their own.  8 strokes,\nstill grade 1, but JLPTN3.</p>\n<p>森 … okay, so we have THREE 木 now.  This is “mori”, translated to a small forest\nor a large wooded area.  Imagine a denser greenery - perhaps harder to traverse.\n12 strokes, again grade 1 and JLPTN3.</p>\n<p>Put all this together and we have 森林 - “shinrin”.  A big forest, like a mountain\ncovered in foliage.  If you’re thinking a forest in English, that’s what we’ve got here.\nLots of 木.</p>\n<p>浴 is yoku.  10 strokes, Grade 4, and JLPTN2.  This one’s a bit tougher.\nIt’s a combination of 氵 (one of the water radicals) and 谷 (“tani”, or valley).\nThis means to bathe in or to bask in.  I suppose you’d be able to bathe in a water valley?</p>\n<p>Put it all together and you have 森林浴, a peaceful walk to bask in the forest.</p>","excerpt":"Kanji is exceptionally confusing to me.
