On Linux, this works pretty okay!  You get a\nwebkit rendering engine (of an unknown version).  On MacOS you get\nthe Safari flavor of webkit.  On Windows 7 you often get IE11 which..\nyikes.  Then on earlier Windows 10 you get the old non-Webkit Edge,\nnewer versions mostly get Webkit Edge.  It’s.. a little all over.</p>\n<p>The big thing that Electron brings is that you know exactly what version\nof Webkit you’re building against and can cut down on the pain you\nfeel when testing.</p>\n<p>I dunno, though, I feel that Electron being resource hungry isn’t the\nend of the world.  For the most part, you can cut down on memory in\nElectron in the same way you would a standard web app on Chrome -\nthrough <a href=\"https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/performance\">profiling and optimization</a>.</p>","excerpt":"There’s a nifty new Electron alternative called Tauri which purports\nto be more memory efficient than Electron!
