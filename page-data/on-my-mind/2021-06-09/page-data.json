This is all a guess, of course, because\nthey’re being relatively hush-hush about the exact details of the problem.\n(Makes sense because we don’t really need to know &#x26; it’s ~24 hours since\nthe actual problem.)</p>\n<p>They did provide a very great blog post and short post-mortem about the\nincident right away, though.
