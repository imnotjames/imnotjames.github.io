It’s all fun and games until someone\ngets hurt, right?</p>\n<p>In space and in micro-gravity we lose the constant of gravity to prevent\nitems from moving in a specific direction.  If you let go of a wrench while\nyou’re moving it, it falls to the ground and friction stops its movement\non Earth.  In space, that wrench will continue in the direction you let\ngo of it and bonk someone in the head.</p>\n<p>This is when you’d need to do a little surgery to suture up your mistake.\nSurgery in space is going to be even more difficult because of a number of\nreasons.</p>\n<p>Without gravity, we don’t have blood being pushed downwards.  Instead, blood\npools in the center of your body.  If this happened on Earth, it would mean\nyou have too much blood!  So your body will try to remove liquid, thus lowering\nyour blood volume significantly.  This brings your standard blood volume\nin space to a pretty low level already.  If you add a wrench to the head,\nthough, you lose even more blood, putting you at a critical level quickly.</p>\n<p>Wound healing in microgravity is also an unknown - we’ve done almost no research\non how wounds will heal in space.  It’s likely that there will be trouble because\nof the lack of gravity pushing downwards.  This is made worse by the fact that your\nimmune system will be heavily suppressed and poorly prepared to fight off infections\nfrom being in the microgravity.  Bacteria grows in even more interesting ways -\ninstead of growing in two-dimensions because gravity holds it down, it\ncan grow in 3 dimensions.</p>\n<p>Without gravity, water will be held together not by gravity, but instead by surface\ntension.  Surface tension will cause the blood to pool together, obscuring the\nview of surgeons.  You’ll need to constantly be clearing the field of view,\nbut given weightlessness and possible bacteria infections it’s difficult to\ndecide what to do with that excess.  That’s also an unknown.</p>\n<p>Suffice it to say - we probably aren’t prepared for this yet.</p>","excerpt":"Microgravity always looks really fun.
