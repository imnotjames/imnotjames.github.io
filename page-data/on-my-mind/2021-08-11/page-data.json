It had an 8 day journey to get to the station.\nNauka is a docking port, a spacewalk airlock, and a whole science facility - the biggest room\nin the International Space Station yet at 13 meters long and a diameter of 4.25 meters.\nNauka launched from Kazakhstan after 14 years of delays.</p>\n<p>Celebrations were had after the docking procedure was successful.</p>\n<p>3 hours later at 12:59PM Eastern the ISS was passing over Indonesia.  Nauka’s autopilot\nwoke up and decided that it was time to take thrust control and leave.  Unfortunately, Nauka was\nstill firmly attached to the station.  This is not ideal for the crew within the station.</p>\n<p>The module started firing its thrusters to position the module for firing its main thruster.\nOutside of radio control from Moscow’s Mission Control, it was unknown that Nauka was firing\nits thrusters.  Only once the ISS started to shift orientation from these thrusters did NASA\ndetect it - but within minutes the Flight Director in Houston started attempts to\ncounteract the spin.</p>\n<p>At the same time, the station’s automated systems began to note the deviation from norm\nand took action to counter the spin via thrusters on the Russian half of the station.\nHouston Mission Control instructed astronauts to close hatches and windows - preparing\nfor the worst.  The ISS was designed to handle this kind of torque - but it was a maneuver\nfar outside normal mission parameters.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2021/07/29/space-station-stable-after-earlier-unplanned-mlm-thruster-firing/\">44 minutes of thruster action rotated the station one and a half turns about its long-axis</a>.\nBy the time the station entered back into Russian radio contact the thruster had exhausted\nits fuel and was dormant.  Moscow Mission Control directed the flight control back to the\nISS from Nauka and sent instructions for the station’s thrusters to return the ISS to\na more desirable orientation.</p>\n<p>Work continued as normal after the disaster had been averted.</p>","excerpt":"The Russian Multipurpose Laboratory module “Nauka” docked with the International Space Station\nat 9:29AM Eastern on July 29th.
