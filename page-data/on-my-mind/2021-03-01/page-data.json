It’s\nalso one of the oldest technqiues in the espionage handbook.  Most of the time\nin this day and age it’s implemented as spear-phishing or in other ways via\nemail.  That’s when you aren’t dealing with highly motivated nation-state\nactors where money and time becomes less of a problem.</p>\n<p>Let’s think like a threat actor for a moment.  Who’s going to look the most\nthreatening to an employee?  The other, of course.  Someone outside the company.\nThat’s why spear-phishing can be so successful - you purport to be someone\ntrusted.  Someone that’s a part of the company.  However, that leaves tech in\nthe way.  That makes it easier to detect, right?</p>\n<p>So then.. let’s pivot.  How can we become someone trustworthy?  Well… What\nif we only needed to fool one employee - someone that wouldn’t expect it -\nand use that to get a foot-hold?  How about.. HR.  HR gets a candidate.  On\npaper, they’re perfect.  They came from top schools, they know your stack,\nthe teams that interview them are gung-ho, their references are all gushing\nabout how amazing this individual is.  And that’s exactly how we get someone\non the inside.</p>\n<p>Sound too outlandish?  It has happened many times - even in recent years.\nAlexey Karetnikov had joined Microsoft as a QA engineer in 2010.\n<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2010/07/who-was-the-12th-russian-spy-at-microsoft/344876/\">It was purported that he was there to capture intelligence</a> for the Russian\nintelligence agencies.  He was on the sloppier side and was tracked by the\nUS intelligence agencies as soon as he set foot in the US.  He was deported\nover charges of immigration violations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/responding-effectively-to-the-chinese-economic-espionage-threat\">The current FBI Director, Christopher Wray, spoke about this as well.</a>\nIn 2020, the Boston FBI field office arrested a researcher that was smuggling\nvials of biological research back to the Chinese government.</p>\n<p>When someone’s as motivated as these folks are and have the backing of a\nnation state nearly anything is possible.  These are just the cases we hear\nabout, too.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Barsky\">Jack Barsky</a> is a more famous example of someone that had\nbeen a spy for the KGB in New York City for 10 years.</p>\n<p>In espionage, reality is often more outlandish than even fiction.</p>","excerpt":"Social engineering is one of the most difficult attack vectors to detect.
