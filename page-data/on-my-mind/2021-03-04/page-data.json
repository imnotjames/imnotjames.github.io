Within the first hour of their life, they\n<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/baby-cephalopods-first-moments-tzuuij/19380/\">start foraging and camoflauging</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2020.3161\">Recent studies</a> have shown that they also possess the capacity for\nexerting self control.  This is commonly known as the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment\">Stanford marshmallow experiment</a>, a study on delayed gratification.</p>\n<p>This does bring into question animal intelligence and conciousness.\nUrbanization means people spend less time with other animals.  We interact\nwith a smaller variety of animals and thus can see much less varied expressions\nof intelligence from them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/octopus-making-contact-preview-a98u9n/19851/\">Dr. David Scheel raised a Day Octopus in his home</a>, documenting the\nexperience.  The Scheel family named her Heidi.  Heidi was able to show\nrecognition of faces, solved puzzles, and built relationships with members\nof the Scheel family.  Of this, Scheel noted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am less intrigued by the differences and more interested in our\nsimilarities. What kind of a connection is possible with an animal that has\nthree hearts and blue blood running through its veins? It’s been a privilege\nto have a relationship with such a strange and wonderful creature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It could be that we aren’t smart enough to judge how smart animals are.\nThe Octopus followed a different evolutionary path than we did.  As such, the\nexpressions of intelligence they have could just be poorly understood by us.\nJust because we excel in a larger number of areas on average doesn’t mean that\nsome animals can do better than some people in specific tasks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=191810&#x26;cid=15757347\">From Slashdot</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Back in the 1980s, Yosemite National Park was having a serious problem\nwith bears: They would wander into campgrounds and break into the garbage\nbins.</p>\n<p>This put both bears and people at risk. So the Park Service started\ninstalling armored garbage cans that were tricky to open — you had to\nswing a latch, align two bits of handle, that sort of thing.</p>\n<p>But it turns out it’s actually quite tricky to get the design of these cans\njust right. Make it too complex and people can’t get them open to put away\ntheir garbage in the first place.</p>\n<p>Said one park ranger, “There is considerable overlap between the intelligence\nof the smartest bears and the dumbest tourists.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps the entire marshmallow test is flawed.  It purports that cuttlefish\nshow intelligence normally seen in toddlers.  Maybe cuttlefish are just able to\nshow intelligence in one aspect that is similar to toddlers.  Or maybe\ncuttlefish aren’t that smart - <a href=\"http://vaviper.blogspot.com/2019/06/from-onion-study-reveals-babies-are.html\">maybe babies are just stupid.</a></p>","excerpt":"The Cephalopod - squid, octopus, nautilus, and cuttlefish - are both adorable\nand incredibly intelligent.
