This is a pretty big deal\nbecause it signals to every organization across the\ngovernment that they need to divert funding to implement\nthis order.</p>\n<p>This Executive Order covers a pretty wide variety of tasks,\nbut a few things specifically stand out to me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>incorporation of NIST guidelines and standards as part of a playbook</li>\n<li>enforcement of Multi-Factor Authentication everywhere in government</li>\n<li>additional expectations of a Software Bill of Materials</li>\n<li>required movement towards a Zero Trust architecture</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The NIST guidelines are not that “out there” all things considered.\nHowever, there’s a number of which that most government agencies don’t\nseem to follow.  Suggestions against Password expiration and arbitrary\npassword composition rules are high up on that list.  Government\nsites also often make it difficult ot use password managers which\nis discouraged by the NIST rules.  NIST has a really handy\n<a href=\"https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/\">FAQ</a> if you’d like the short version.</p>\n<p>Multi-factor Authentication is pretty clear in NIST to not\nbe SMS and not be email.  This is to be adopted by agencies\nwithin 180 days of the order - and if they can’t adopt it within\nthat time frame they must explain why not every 60 days to\nDHS / CISA / etc.  Hopefully, most organizations will choose\nexisting solutions like login.gov to implement this.</p>\n<p>Software Bill of Materials is less clear as to what\nit’s really requiring.  The executive order does not\ndefine this, but does set in place the requirement\nthat a definition must be published within 60 days\nby the Secretary of Commerce.</p>\n<p>Zero-Trust architecture is where there will be a huge\namount of work to be done.  This is designing systems in\na way that encourages defense with both public and private\ninteractions of systems.  Expect that there’s a potential\nthreat actor that’s breached your network.  With that in\nmind, you can’t give full access to just anyone and everything.\nInstead, you have to clearly define access and privileges,\nenforcing controls on who gets what and why.</p>\n<p>I’m excited to see an executive order that takes cyber security\nseriously.  Thanks to Beau Woods for tipping me off\nabout this, I hadn’t even heard of it!</p>","excerpt":"President Biden signed an Executive Order to improve the\nNation’s Cybersecurity posture.
