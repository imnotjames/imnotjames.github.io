On a few occasions they are thrown off the carpet\nbut it catches them.  You know.  Safe.  60 seconds later they’re at\nwhat looks like the Great Sphinx of Giza.  15 seconds later they\nare at what looks like the Parthenon in Athens.</p>\n<p>The distance from the Sphinx in Giza to the Parthenon in Athens\nis 615 miles across the Mediterranean Sea.  To travel this in 15\nseconds that magic carpet ride would be traveling in excess of\n150,000 miles per hour - or roughly Mach 195.  This puts them in\nthe same league as a faster than average meteor.  Meteors heat up\nboth from air friction as well as the compression of air in front\nof them, and thus it would be safe to believe the magic carpet\nride would have burst into flames as it travels across the sea.</p>\n<p>Assuming they decelerate over the course of 3 seconds (perhaps\nwhen Aladdin is saying there’s time to spare) they would have\nexperienced 2200 times the force of gravity.  If Aladdin is\naround 120lbs normally (he’s a street rat, after all), his body\nwould have felt like it weighed ~280,000lbs.  For reference,\na blue whale is 290,000lbs.</p>\n<p>So, per Jasmine’s question, “Is It Safe?”, most certainly not.\nIf it weren’t for the fact that it’s “magic” I wouldn’t trust\nprince Ali with anyone’s safety on that thing.</p>","excerpt":"I can open your eyes\nTake you wonder by wonder\nOver sideways and under\nOn a magic carpet ride How magical is that magic carpet ride, though…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-07-29"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/07/29"}},"previous":{"id":"4ebdc8a8-45dd-5ef7-994c-8822cc40662e","fields":{"slug":"/2021-07-02"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/07/02"}},"next":{"id":"2eb04085-592e-5783-adbf-53511bbf2b68","fields":{"slug":"/2021-08-11"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/08/11"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-07-29","previous":"/2021-07-02","next":"/2021-08-11"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
