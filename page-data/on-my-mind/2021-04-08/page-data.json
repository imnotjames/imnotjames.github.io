Especially those with milder\nclimates.  However, most articles gloss over rural areas with more extreme\nclimates.  It’s one thing to try to trudge around New York City when it’s a\nhumid 95F / 35C day.  It’s uncomfortable and you might end up a little sweaty.\nIt’s an entirely different story to bike the 35 miles from Frisco, Texas into\ndowntown Dallas during the 115F / 46C summer.  It’s downright dangerous.</p>\n<p>Bicycling is great if it’s an option - but it own’t be for everyone.  While\nelectric vehicles aren’t entirely carbon zero, they’re better than many\nalternatives while being feasible “replacements”.</p>\n<p>But if you’re in a city and can bike somewhere?  Do that.  It’s healthier, too.</p>","excerpt":"We’re moving away from fossil fuels in our day to day transit as electric\nvehicles are becoming more viable for our transportation needs…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-08"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/08"}},"previous":{"id":"b4a2192c-6c08-56da-bdae-1bdba23efc44","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-07"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/07"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-04-08","previous":"/2021-04-07","next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
