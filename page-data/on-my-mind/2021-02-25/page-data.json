The Videocassette Recorder was\nfeared by the television industry and heralded by consumers.\nA new way to consume movies and television was born with the VHS.</p>\n<p>There was one issue with translating theatrical movies to the small screen:\nHome televisions were 4:3 aspect ratio.  This meant that the the screens had\na width of 1.33 times the height unlike the new <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CinemaScope\">Cinemascope</a> and other\nWidescreen formats for theatrical releases that became popular after 1960.</p>\n<p>Two techniques are available to make the widescreen theatrical releases\nfit on a smaller screen.  There’s always letterboxing - which adds black bars\nabove and below the screen.  Another technique is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_and_scan\">Pan and Scan</a> - where\nthe image is translated to better show off the points of interest in the\ncinematography, shaping the film to match the 4:3 through cropping or other\ntechniques.  This would be done by an editor and could drastically change\nthe tone of a scene if done poorly.  This is why many criticize and refuse\nto release a pan and scan version.</p>\n<p>The kind of film that would do well in the “home cinema” also differed\nfrom what would do well in the theater.</p>\n<p>In the the theater there is less need to keep the audience’s attention -\nthey were stuck there in the building.  At home, you have distractions so a\ndifferent kind of movie can prosper.  Comedy movies like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mallrats\">Mallrats</a>,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Lebowski\">The Big Lebowski</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space\">Office Space</a> did ABYSMALLY in the theater but\nfound their footing once they were released on VHS.  Some of this is\nattributed to the fact that they can be enjoyed more recreationally and\nsporadically than many other movies that require direct attention.</p>\n<p>The Horror film genre <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thing_(1982_film)\">The Thing</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abyss\">The Abyss</a>, and “slasher” movies like\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween_(1978_film)\">Halloween</a> did extraorgdinarily well on VHS.  This could because.. what’s\nscarier than when the monster is.. inside your own house?  On the small screen\nit’s harder to see what’s going on but sometimes that adds to the fear.. plus,\nyou can’t see the zipper so easily on the scary demon monster.</p>\n<p>There’s also some films that wouldn’t be as popular today if it weren’t for\nhome video - such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labyrinth_(1986_film)\">Labyrinth</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blade_Runner\">Blade Runner</a>,\nor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Trouble_in_Little_China\">Big Trouble in Little China</a>.  These three did not do well in the box\noffice but sold well on home video.  A good thing, too - they’re all fantastic\nfilms and it’s a good thing they weren’t forgotten.</p>\n<p>VHS may be gone - <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/brittanyhodak/2016/07/23/rip-vhs-worlds-last-vcr-to-be-made-this-month/?sh=4ec4c88623da\">the last VCR was produced in 2016</a> - but it’s\nstill in our collective pop-culture memory.  You get the same gritty effects\nused all over videos online - giving a bit of realism that it’s a “found”\ntape.  There’s even an anthology Horror series called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V/H/S\">V/H/S</a> which uses the\nthe look of VHS tapes to hide all of the imperfections of CGI to great effect.</p>\n<p>Myself?  I just remember the joy of being able to watch Star Wars\nin the warmth of my pajamas on Saturday while eating some cereal.</p>","excerpt":"In the before times, two titans battled out a war in North America - a bitter\nande drawn out war that waged on for decades.
