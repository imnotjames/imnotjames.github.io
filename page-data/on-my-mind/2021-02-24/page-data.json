Heck, I only wore shirts\nthat were swag because they were free.  It was great because I wouldn’t have\nto pay for them and they were decently high quality! </p>\n<p>Now a days, I don’t really want that stuff.  The last conference I went to I even\nwon a new computer monitor (thanks, I guess, Asus?) which I promptly gave\nto a friend because I already have a monitor and didn’t want to bring it back\non a train.</p>\n<p>Getting swag can be exciting - except for when I have 10 venmo hoodies, 4 Wayfair\nhoodies, 2 jackets that are branded elsewhere, and now more socks than I know what\nto do with.  It’s just not much of a marketing channel for me anymore.</p>\n<p>I say that - but then came the time when I spoke with the Pokemon Company.\nThey give out nice shirts that were exclusive, high quality, and from a brand that\nI have an affinity for.</p>\n<p>So, exclusive, high quality, and engaging brands.  They don’t really even\nneed to market to me, but do.  So why is it that <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90260185/its-time-to-stop-spending-billions-on-cheap-conference-swag\">companies spend billions</a>\non low quality garbage to give out at conferences?  Do we need more\ntiny and useless thumb drives, pop-sockets, or totes?  (They shouldn’t.)</p>\n<p>For companies giving out swag to employees there’s now entire companies devoted\nto creating these - like <a href=\"https://www.swagup.com/\">SwagUp</a>.  This is a little more interesting as\nan employee but…</p>\n<p>I’d rather just get snacks, experiences, or other things that I can\nconsume rather than more things that’ll probably end up in a landfill.</p>","excerpt":"Having not gone to any conferences, conventions, or the like for a while\na quora post caught my eye being shared in discord.
