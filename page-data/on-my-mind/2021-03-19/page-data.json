Originally brought\nto Ireland in the 12th century via the Norman Invasion, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tudor_conquest_of_Ireland\">Tudor conquest</a>\nled to English speaking immigrants flooding Ireland, and a general suppresion of\nthe Irish language.  More recently, <a href=\"https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/ilg/\">only 4% of surveyed Irish speakers</a>\nspeak Gaelige in their daily life.  Otherwise, English is the predominant language\nof the land.</p>\n<p>While the English attempted suppress anything other than the traditional\nEnglish at the time, there’s been a number of differences that have grown to\nmake Irish English unique across the gamut - grammar, vocabulary, and phonetics,\nMuch of this is holdover from Gaelige, which makes it doubly interesting.</p>\n<p>One particularly interesting grammatical difference is that “yes” and “no” are\nfar less frequently used.  For example, “You speak with an Irish dialect?” would\nbe responded with “I do” instead of “Yes”.  Much of this is due to\nthe Irish language lacking “yes” or “no” as vocabulary.  Instead,\nthe verb is negated and responded with.</p>\n<p>Hiberno-English pulls a number of words from Gaeilge as loan-words, as well\nas some that are merely derived from the national language.  “Sláinte!” is\none that you might hear in a pub, meaning “(To your) Health!”  And if you’re\nnervous, you might “fooster” - to fidget - derived from the Gaeilge word\n“Fústar”.  In other cases, Hiberno-English has vocabulary that is less\nclearly historied - such as when you’ve really broken something?  It’s\n“banjaxed”.</p>\n<p>The phonology of Hiberno-English is probably what differs the most between\nthe regions.  I’ll be frank - I’m not a phonetics expert, and <a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/84678944.pdf\">every paper</a>\nI’ve read on this really goes all out on that.  A few examples, however,\nare words like “kite” that to American ears would sound like “koyt”,\n“mouth” which would be closer to “meh-ooth” or “maith”, and\n“about” would be close to “a boat”.</p>\n<p>Now don’t be a lúdramán, and give céad míle fáilte when yer with the Irish, will you?\nThey do be thinking yer an eejit if ya talk like this, yeah?</p>","excerpt":"While Ireland’s Gaeilge is the national and official language of the Republic of Ireland,\nmany regions of Ireland speak a dialect of English…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-19"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/03/19"}},"previous":{"id":"c5bc159a-e788-5f21-a1f4-2fa64f435527","fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-18"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/03/18"}},"next":{"id":"428b9449-e9bb-5965-aa16-768530dc4699","fields":{"slug":"/2021-03-29"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/03/29"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-03-19","previous":"/2021-03-18","next":"/2021-03-29"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
