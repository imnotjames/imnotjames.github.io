This is very true!  There’s a lot\nto be said of the impact you can have in that first sentence.\nThis applies not just to books - you have a miniscule amount\nof time to leave a good impression and bring people in.</p>\n<p>However, there’s quite a bit also to be said about not starting\nwith that opening sentence.  You don’t need to get it right\nfirst thing.  A terrible book with an amazing initial line\nis just a book that everyone will read and hate.</p>\n<p>If you can iterate, you can eventually get that amazing sentence\nthat gets everyone to pick up what you’re selling.</p>\n<p>John Swartzwelder, a writer for the simpsons,\n<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/john-swartzwelder-sage-of-the-simpsons\">gives advice on the subject</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do have a trick that makes things easier for me. Since writing\nis very hard and rewriting is comparatively easy and rather fun,\nI always write my scripts all the way through as fast as I can,\nthe first day, if possible, putting in crap jokes and pattern dialogue—\n“Homer, I don’t want you to do that.” “Then I won’t do it.”\nThen the next day, when I get up, the script’s been written.\nIt’s lousy, but it’s a script. The hard part is done. It’s like a\ncrappy little elf has snuck into my office and badly done all my\nwork for me, and then left with a tip of his crappy hat.\nAll I have to do from that point on is fix it. So I’ve taken\na very hard job, writing, and turned it into an easy one,\nrewriting, overnight. I advise all writers to do their\nscripts and other writing this way.</p>\n<p>And be sure to send me a small royalty every time you do it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This, of course, applies beyond just script writing.  Software, products,\nwhatever it may be - often, the biggest roadblock you will have is\nthat initial impetus to get things rolling.  Once you have something\nit’s much easier to make smaller improvements.</p>\n<p>With that in mind, go forth and embrace the crappy little elf that\nbuilds the v0.1 of whatever you’re making.  Then, show them\nhow much better you can make it.</p>","excerpt":"I read a wonderful blog post about the opening lines\nof novels and their importance.  This is very true!
