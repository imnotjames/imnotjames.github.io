What it does that\nmakes it “smart” is that it disposes of the object when the pointer goes out of\nscope.  This is most often done using the <code class=\"language-text\">delete</code> operator, but can also be\nsupplied by the developer.</p>\n<p>This NFT pointer implementation has the same semantics and usability of a\ntraditional smart pointer, but also is on the Ethereum blockchain, making it\nsuperior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As we all know, adding blockchain to a problem automatically\nmakes it simple, transparent, and cryptographically secure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The difference in performance between the two is negligible\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_universe\">in the grand scheme of things</a>, with <code class=\"language-text\">std::unique_ptr</code> running in\n0.005 seconds, followed quickly behind by <code class=\"language-text\">nft_ptr</code> at 3 minutes per call.</p>\n<p>I applaud Zhuowei Zhang’s efforts to bring crytocurrency to more widespread\nappeal.  <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhuowei/nft_ptr/main/white_paper.pdf\">For more information, check out their whitepaper</a>.</p>","excerpt":"Yet another great step for cryptocurrency enthusiasts, there’s now an\nimplementation of  backed by crytpo NFTs!
