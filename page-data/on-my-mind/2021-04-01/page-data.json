This can be squarely blamed\non a more sedentary lifestyle than is ideal.  This doesn’t mean I can’t.\nWe’re all <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IxuThNgl3YA\">Born to Run</a> in our own ways.  Some hypotheses even suggest that\nwe should take that pretty literally.</p>\n<p>For example, look at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rar%C3%A1muri\">Rarámuri</a> peoples - 5KM might feel like a lot,\nbut they’re known to long-distance running.  Extremely long-distance running.\nUp to 320KM in one session, often over the course of multiple days.  That isn’t\neven on flat surfaces, either.  It’s through canyon and brush, with rather\nsignificant elevation changes and rough terrain.</p>\n<p>What’s more, the Rarámuri also have competitive aspects to their running,\nsuch as the game <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rarajipari\">Rarajipari</a> - a game of kicking and chasing a ball.  Even\ncasual games will go on for several miles.  However, after some serious\nall-night partying they will do equally serious matches which go on for thirty\nto fourty miles.</p>\n<p>While much of that can seem extreme, it’s led many to lean into the\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endurance_running_hypothesis\">Endurance running hypothesis</a> - that certain human characteristics can be\nexplained by our need to run extended distances.  Sure, it’s just a hypothesis,\nand there’s definitely some areas where it falters - but it’s interesting\nnonetheless.</p>\n<p>For example - we have shorter toes than other primates.  For grasping, this\nmakes us greatly inferior.  We lost overall strength and gripping capabilities.\nWith such short toes, how am I supposed to hang from the monkey bars with just\nmy toes?  However, shorter toes mean less mechanical work is needed to support\nweight.  Less exertion is put on the joints, and we can support 75% of our body\nweight on just our toes.  In running, this is incredibly important - as we often\nwill end up landing on our toes - and those longer toes would cause injuries.</p>\n<p>What does it all mean, though?  Well, you might not run 300KM in a single go\ntoday - but I’m sure 5KM is a good start on it.</p>","excerpt":"Today, running 5KM took a lot out of me.
