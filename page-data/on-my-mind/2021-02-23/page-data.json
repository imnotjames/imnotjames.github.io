It’s no surprise that we crave human interaction\nwhen we can’t see one another!  However, Zoom just feels too… meeting-ish.\nCommunities don’t really form around Zoom.  I think that’s why folks are\nturning to more “video game”-like aspects to break the physical distances\nbetween us.</p>\n<p>When we’re meeting in person, we’re usually limited by physics.  This is\nsomething we’re really used to.  You can only have so many people in a room,\nyou can’t really hear folks outside of a short distance away, and you know\nwhen someone is talking to you because they are usually giving you their\nattention.</p>\n<p>So - simulating those physical limitations has been seen in a few products\n(games?  tools?  communication devices?) that’ve been dropping.  I’d first\nseen something like this at the Recurse Center - they have Virtual RC &#x26; it’s\nreally neat!  It’s like being in the RC space but you’re represented by just\na little avatar version of your face.  I think there’s a few other ways that\nthis can work - and products show that’s the case as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://waxy.org/2021/02/announcing-skittish/\">Skittish</a> is one of these - and I saw it on the front page of Hacker\nNews.  You get an avatar that’s a Raccoon or an Owl or a snake - and you\nhang out in a virtual space, watch videos together, all that.  It’s neat,\nbut definitely limited in what it can do.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://gather.town/\">Gather.town</a> is a bit older, and if I remember correctly had Pokemon\nsprites to begin with, way back.  A few college students tossed it together\nand put it up online &#x26; it grew like wildfire.</p>\n<p>To go a bit more realistic, there’s <a href=\"https://hubs.mozilla.com/\">Hub by Mozilla</a>.  This is available\nvia VR and feels much more video-gamey than the others.  You can easily modify\nthe space you’re in and customize it together with other people.  I’ve seen\na number of other examples like this - the closest being Rec Room.</p>\n<p>There’s still <a href=\"https://www.connect.secondlife.com/about\">Second Life</a> and Second Life has been around.. forever.\nThing is… Second Life gets weird.  Real weird.  Let’s not think about that\ntoo much.</p>\n<p>I think there’s always a want for Human connection, though.  It doesn’t even\nhave to be instant.  Sometimes you just want to listen to some chilled out\nmusic and write letters to people via a deer postman.\n<a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/1070710/Kind_Words_lo_fi_chill_beats_to_write_to/\">Kind Words (lo fi chill beats to write to)</a> gives you that experience.\nKind Words is about writing nice letters and reading nice letters from other\npeople.  It makes you feel much better inside than many other interactions.</p>\n<p>To be honest?  I think we need less Zoom and we need more Kind Words\nin the world.</p>","excerpt":"The ongoing pandemic has led to everyone feeling a little disconnected\nfrom one-another.
