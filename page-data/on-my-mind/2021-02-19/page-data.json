The mission is one of the most ambitious\nwe’ve sent to the red planet - but not just because of the rover\n(which, itself, is the most complex and featured rover we’ve sent).</p>\n<p>The EDL (Entry, Descent, and Landing) platform was also for more advanced\nthan any other we’d sent - with the descent into the Martian atmosphere\nbeing yet another part of the experiment.  The ablative heat shielding\ncovered the bottom of the capsule - with a type of plating covering it\nwhich upon heating would vaporize and be carried away from the\nPerseverance capsule.</p>\n<p>The Perseverance also carried 661lbs of tungsten weights.  However, just\nbecause they’re dead weight doesn’t mean they won’t serve a purpose.</p>\n<p>Two 165 pound blocks of tungsten kept Perseverance in a stable and balanced\nspin on its journey from Earth.  This prevented any one side of the capsule\nfrom getting too hot.  These are jettisoned 900 miles or so above Mars as\nthey’d no longer be needed.  Waste not, though.  These two tungsten blocks\nwill slam into the surface of Mars at 9,000 mph or so and is\n<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/science/nasa-mars-landing.html\">part of a very vital experiment</a>.  The InSight lander has a\nseismometer and even at 2000 miles away it’ll be listening for Perseverance\nknocking with these tungsten payloads.</p>\n<p>Removing those two tungsten blocks is an important part of the entry phase\nbecause while balance is required during the journey, the entry requires\ndebalancing.  Because one side of the capsule is heavier than the other\nthe entry angle will be at 16°.  This leads to a slight amount of lift\nexperienced by the craft, allowing the descent to be controlled via\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaction_control_system\">RCS (Reaction Control System)</a> powered rotation - rotate left to\ncause the lift to push you one way, right to push the other, and go left\nand right consistently to burn off speed.  This is all autonomous!</p>\n<p>There’s also six 55lb tungsten masses that ensure landing is aligned.\nThese are jettisoned right before firing the parachute and are used to\nensure that the radar will be oriented in the correct direction.  While\nthe RCS was fired roughly 2,256 times during atmosphere entry, at this point\nthey aren’t a whole lot of use.  These tungsten blocks are jettisoned two at\na time, and will cause the craft to roll into the exact orientation needed\nfor the rest of the descent.</p>\n<p>Haven’t heard yet if InSight heard Perseverance’s hello to start a welcome\nparty, but all of this was fantastically interesting to me and I’m always\nsurprised at how much NASA can achieve.</p>\n<p>Wanna watch it?  <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/videos/919215638\">They streamed the landing on twitch!</a>\nWhat an amazing future we live in.</p>","excerpt":"The Perseverance rover confirmed a successful touchdown yesterday,\nFebruary 19th at ~3:55PM EST.
