Battle-tested technology.  Things that everyone on the team\nknows.  The argument for boring technology is generally that you won’t\nget anything that surprises you.</p>\n<p>Exciting Technology is … uh.. okay, so bear with me: the examples given\nare Cassandra (at least 12 years old), MongoDB (>11 years),\nClojure (>14 years), and NodeJS (..let’s not touch that).  For the sake of\nsimplicity, let’s say Exciting Technology is technology that an\nengineer is less familiar with and as such cannot for certain say\nthat it will solve the issues they currently have - but there are\nsome shiny new features that they really like!</p>\n<p>Let’s … not talk touch on my personal experiences with Cassandra, Mongo,\nand the like.  Let’s not touch on the issues that seemed to be the case\nat Etsy’s SRE &#x26; maintenance of servers.  Let’s not even touch on all the\nfighting going on in the HN comments.</p>\n<p>Instead, I think it’s interesting to talk about the kinds of people\nthat do this because I don’t think that either of these articles will\nchange people’s minds.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering-dp-1484221575/dp/1484221575/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\">Managing Humans by Michael Lopp</a> is a book that’s not just about\nmanaging humans.  In it he writes about engineering culture, different\npersonalities you might find, and communication skills.  Things that are\nsometimes considered tangential to management (but are very important!)</p>\n<p>The chapter “Stables and Volatiles” details two archetypes that you’ll\ncommonly see within engineering cultures. </p>\n<p>Stables are engineers that happily work within a set of confines - even\nappreciating these confines such as direction and deadlines.  They assess\nrisk, carefully mitigate failure, and aim for predictable outcomes.</p>\n<p>Volatiles will show up, stomp on everything that exists, and leave a trail\nof disruption in their wake.  However, when they build.. they sure build a LOT.\nIn some cases, what they make will be novel and would not have occurred\notherwise.</p>\n<p>Stables and Volatiles are at odds with one another.  They do not get along\non everything but a team with both can be incredibly successful - even if\nthere’s a bit of conflict along the way.  Volatiles become stables,\nand sometime stables become volatiles, and neither is really good or bad.\nThey just <em>are</em>.</p>\n<p>These archetypes are applicable to the argument about boring versus exciting\ntechnology.  Stables will more likely than not choose the familiar.\nVolatiles will sometimes choose the foreign.  Neither is right or wrong -\nat least not intrinsically.  Instead, it’s gotta be a balance and you’ve\ngot to use the right tool for the right job.</p>\n<p>If you lean too far towards boring technology nothing will be pushed forward.\nIf you lean too far towards the exciting you’ll end up with a backend written\nin <a href=\"https://www.little-lang.org/\">Little</a> using a home-grown <a href=\"https://dfithian.github.io/2021/02/15/database-implementation-part-1.html\">database written in Haskell</a>.  That..\ndoes sound pretty exciting, though, doesn’t it?</p>","excerpt":"There were two posts on the front page of Hacker News yesterday -\nChoose Boring Technology and Choose Exciting Technology.\nBoth make are…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-22"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/22"}},"previous":{"id":"7452eb3e-f058-5ab8-b252-e716173ca5d0","fields":{"slug":"/2021-02-20"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/02/20"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-02-22","previous":"/2021-02-20","next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
