OVH had a small <a href=\"http://travaux.ovh.net/?do=details&#x26;id=49471&#x26;\">datacenter fire</a> which affected their SBG datacenter.\nThis is not that uncommon of a problem for a datacenter.  That’s why you should\nalways have a Disaster Recovery Plan if your data is invaluable - beyond\nreliance on fire suppression systems.</p>\n<p>Fire suppression in datacenters pose an interesting problem.  When you have\nso many things that can’t get wet and are incredibly expensive to replace\nyou can’t use sprinklers, and any residue could be heavily damaging\nto the equipment as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromotrifluoromethane\">Bromotrifluoromethane</a>, or Halon, was developed in the 1950s as a\ngaseous fire suppression agent for use with valuable materials - such\nas computers and telecommunications systems.  In the mid-90s we stopped\nusing Halon because it is incredibly damaging to the ozone layer and\ncontributes considerably towards global warming.  However much damage\nit causes to the planet, it’s relatively safe for humans.  While Halon\nmay cause dizziness and tingling in the extremities at the low amounts\nit may be effective at, it is relatively safe to be used in close\nquarters.  This is why even now the FAA reccommends it for aircraft!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,1,1,2,3,3,3-Heptafluoropropane\">HFC-227ea</a> is another gaseous fire suppression agent used in data centers.\nGenerally, this is safe for humans at up to 9% concentration, which is the\nmaximum most fire suppression systems would use.  It doesn’t deplete the ozone\nlayer but does contribute to climate change in other ways.  At incredibly high\nheat, however, it does decompose into hydrogen fluoride - which can cause\nblindness and creates hydrofluoric acid on contact with moisture.</p>\n<p>Most fire suppression systems have an alarm before they go off and may\nbe manually prevented.  If you’re interested, there’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QUZ83WcedK0\">a simulation video</a>\nvideo which has some obnoxious music but is otherwise accurate.  I’ve been part\nof this before in a data center, and it’s not a fun time.  I was not inside when\nthe fire suppression activated, thankfully!</p>\n<p>Of course, not much of this matters once the datacenter gets to the point\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/xgarreau/status/1369559995491172354\">SGB2 just did</a>.  Don’t worry, though!  That data center is still\n<a href=\"http://status.ovh.com/vms/index_sbg2.html\">green across the board according to its status page</a>!</p>","excerpt":"Oh no!
