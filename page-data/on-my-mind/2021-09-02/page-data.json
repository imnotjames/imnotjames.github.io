Dial up every number in an area code and listen for modems, fax machines, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system\">bulletin board systems</a>.\nPhone numbers can have a wide variety of systems behind them, but aside from phone books\nthere’s no record of what these might be.  Part of that is because the only way to know.. is to call.</p>\n<p>Valtteri Lehtinen called nearly 60,000 numbers in Finland to understand the telephone network better.\nThis was done via a VoIP trunk to make simple calls over GSM - cellular connections.  Once a call\nwas connected, they recorded 60 seconds of audio for classification then hung up.  They tried to\nfocus on only public numbers and ignored any premium numbers that would have run out their calling\ncredits too quickly.</p>\n<p>Over the course of 40 days they found that only 3% of calls were answered, and only 70% were interesting.\nThere were only 74 unique and interesting responses.  These ranged from machines, faxes,\nand systems for presenting information to callers.</p>\n<p>One was a message with the following:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">Welcome to the end of the world.\nThere is still some hope left.\nIf you want to be rescued then press 1.\nIf you want to join the zombie army then press 2.\nChoose something quickly, we don&#39;t have all day.\n...\nYou have chosen to be a zombie and join the zombie army.\nPlease wait patiently to be bitten.\nPlease do not call again.\nThank you for calling.</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>","excerpt":"Wardialing is an information reconnaissance technique to find phone numbers of interest within a\nlist.
