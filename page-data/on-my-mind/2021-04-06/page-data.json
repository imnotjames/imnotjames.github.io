A portmanteau of Utility and Corridor, the Utilidor is the\ntrue “first floor” of the theme park.  In most places in Florida, you dig a\nfew feet down?  You hit water.  Building underground is thus mostly a\ndangerous and difficult proposition.  Thus, most of the Magic Kingdom is\nabout 100ft above sea level.</p>\n<p>The Utilidor is used for logistics in the park.  Getting anything from point\nA to point B magically can be done via the tunnel systems.</p>\n<p>Employees (referred to as “Cast Members” per corporate mandate) travel between\nlocations using the Utilidor.  This allows them to navigate quickly using\nelectric vehicles &#x26; get in the correct locations quickly for their work.\nThe Utilidor also houses a number of services for employees - such as\ncafeterias, banking services, hair salons, and more.</p>\n<p>What I think is the most interesting, however, is the automated vacuum waste\ncollection within the Utilidor.  The utilidor has pneumatic tubes to quickly\nwhisk away any and all trash away from the park - to where it can be\ndisposed of or recycled.  This helps the custodial staff keep the park as\nclean as it is - by taking all the trash and dumping it somewhere else.</p>\n<p>There are “Backstage” tours of Walt Disney World that show off the utilidor\namong other ways that the magic is preserved at the theme park.  Even if\nsome of the illusion can be dispelled, though, it’s still real magic if you\nbelieve in it.</p>","excerpt":"Disney World is a monumental effort to make it the Most Magical place on Earth.\nMuch of this is attributed to the extreme amounts of…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-06"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/06"}},"previous":{"id":"2a82c9e4-2fb4-52f2-9667-9cca15da60d4","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-05"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/05"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-04-06","previous":"/2021-04-05","next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
