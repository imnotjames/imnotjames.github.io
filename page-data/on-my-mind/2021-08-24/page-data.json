The idea is that you create a fake form that looks like a\nsimple login page, the password manager fills in the credentials and then\ndeletes the form after shipping the credentials off.</p>\n<p>So - you get the advantage of a much lower level of effort credential\ncollection approach.  This is usually for the security / ease of use tradeoff.\nGot it, though, let’s disable autofill globally - that solves the problem,\nright?</p>\n<p>Well.. no.  If you have an XSS vulnerability even without a password manager\nit’s already game over - you’ll be losing that password.  Change the URL via the\nhistory API to be the correct URL, throw the fake login page out, collect the credential\nthe user types in.</p>\n<p>While it’s safer to disable autofill the question brought up is “will people use it?”\nIf the ease of use gets folks to use different passwords between services.. it’s\na security win in my book even if these new vectors are opened.</p>","excerpt":"An article was posted last month about the the dangers of autofill in password managers.\nThe thought is that if there’s Cross Site Scripting…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-08-24"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/08/24"}},"previous":{"id":"2eb04085-592e-5783-adbf-53511bbf2b68","fields":{"slug":"/2021-08-11"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/08/11"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-08-24","previous":"/2021-08-11","next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
