Further, gait can be inferred\nand <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29236078/\">level of intoxication</a> can be interpreted.  This can also give a guess\non <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7299356\">how heavy of a load a person is carrying</a>. </p>\n<p>Taking all of this a bit further, you can even determine what is being said or\nwritten via these devices.  Determining specifc <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2742647.2742658\">spoken “hotwords” could be done</a>\nvia accelerometer alone.  It’s also possible to figure out what someone has typed\non their phone’s virtual keyboard without actually having access to the keyboard\nthrough <a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.359.9767&#x26;rep=rep1&#x26;type=pdf\">only the movements of the phone</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.452.8357&#x26;rep=rep1&#x26;type=pdf\">Inference beyond this can be done</a> to get fuzzier understanding of who someone is\nwithout actually know who they are.  Someone’s physical activity and timing can\ninfer someone’s socioeconomic status, openness, and extraversion.  It can be used\nto understand someone’s mood, their relationships with others, and overall stress\nlevels.  It can also be used to determine age and gender based on gait, movement\nparameters, and activity.</p>\n<p>The short version, though?  We really need to enforce the privacy related to\nwearable devices.  It’s an imperative for our safety.</p>","excerpt":"A paper submitted to ACM in 2019 reviewed the privacy implications of\naccelerometer data as of that time.
