This has been ongoing since August 2010.</p>\n<p>TLDR: It’s fair use, the declaring code is very small and is not\nimplementation, but instead a general organization. As such, it’s fair use.</p>\n<p>Let’s read a couple excerpts!</p>\n<p>The most succinct description of how this is fair use:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google copied these lines not because of their creativity or beauty but\nbecause they would allow programmers to bring their skills to a new\nsmartphone computing environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But does this mean that programs in general are not copyrightable?\nThe following decides that’s not the case:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As part of an interface, the copied lines are inherently\nbound together with uncopyrightable ideas (the overall organization of\nthe API) and the creation of new creative expression (the code inde-\npendently written by Google). Unlike many other computer programs,\nthe value of the copied lines is in significant part derived from the in-\nvestment of users (here computer programmers) who have learned the\nAPI’s system. Given these differences, application of fair use here is\nunlikely to undermine the general copyright protection that Congress\nprovided for computer programs</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How much of the code is considered copied:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one considers the declaring code in isolation, the quan-\ntitative amount of what Google copied was large. Google\ncopied the declaring code for 37 packages of the Sun Java\nAPI, totaling approximately 11,500 lines of code. Those\nlines of code amount to virtually all the declaring code\nneeded to call up hundreds of different tasks. On the other\nhand, if one considers the entire set of software material in\nthe Sun Java API, the quantitative amount copied was\nsmall. The total set of Sun Java API computer code, includ-\ning implementing code, amounted to 2.86 million lines, of\nwhich the copied 11,500 lines were only 0.4 percent</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, my favorite part of the entire decision is that they retell one of\nthe world’s shortest short stories:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.</p>\n</blockquote>","excerpt":"The Supreme Court has come to a decision on the Google v Oracle case\nregarding Google’s usage of the Java SE API in Android’s Android…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-05"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/05"}},"previous":{"id":"349d63e6-a76e-574e-8c8c-a092c5c7d4f4","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-02"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/02"}},"next":{"id":"1f3e4291-a218-531c-af07-17c372e3d799","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-06"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/06"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-04-05","previous":"/2021-04-02","next":"/2021-04-06"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
