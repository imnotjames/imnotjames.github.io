This has been ongoing since August 2010.</p>\n<p>TLDR: It’s fair use, the declaring code is very small and is not\nimplementation, but instead a general organization.  As such, it’s fair use.</p>\n<p>Let’s read a couple excerpts!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Google copied these lines not because of their creativity or beauty but\nbecause they would allow programmers to bring their skills to a new\nsmartphone computing environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>use  is  inherently  bound  together  with  uncopyrightable\nideas (general task division and organization) and new cre-\native  expression  (Android’s  implementing  code).    Unlike\nmany other programs, its value in significant part derives\nfrom the  value  that  those  who  do  not  hold  copyrights,\nnamely, computer  programmers,  invest  of  their  own  time\nand effort to learn the API’s system.  And unlike many other\nprograms, its value lies in its efforts to encourage program-\nmers to learn and to use that system so that they will use\n(and continue to use) Sun-related implementing programs\nthat Google did not copy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one considers the declaring code in isolation, the quan-\ntitative  amount  of  what  Google  copied  was  large.    Google\ncopied the declaring code for 37 packages of the Sun Java\nAPI,  totaling  approximately  11,500  lines  of  code.    Those\nlines  of  code  amount  to  virtually  all  the  declaring  code\nneeded to call up hundreds of different tasks.  On the other\nhand, if one considers the entire set of software material in\nthe  Sun  Java  API,  the  quantitative  amount  copied  was\nsmall.  The total set of Sun Java API computer code, includ-\ning  implementing  code,  amounted  to  2.86  million  lines,  of\nwhich the copied 11,500 lines were only 0.4 percent</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, my favorite part of the entire decision is that they retell one of\nthe world’s shortest short stories:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.</p>\n</blockquote>","excerpt":"The Supreme Court has come to a decision on the Google v Oracle case\nregarding Google’s usage of the Java SE API in Android’s Android…","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-05"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/05"}},"previous":{"id":"349d63e6-a76e-574e-8c8c-a092c5c7d4f4","fields":{"slug":"/2021-04-02"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021/04/02"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/2021-04-05","previous":"/2021-04-02","next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
