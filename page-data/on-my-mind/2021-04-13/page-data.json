The Android app has already been\nrebranded to Google TV (not to be confused with <a href=\"https://tv.google/\">Google TV</a>).\nThis continues Google’s tradition of <a href=\"https://killedbygoogle.com/\">killing products</a>.</p>\n<p>Google Play Music was taken out a few months back, with Youtube\nMusic being the replacement.  This was such a difficult transition\nthat I started paying for Spotify for my parents to use.</p>\n<p>To understand why this is (I am not a Xoogler and I am sure SOMEONE\nhere would have a clearer picture to this) it helps to understand\npromotions at Google!  Promotions at higher levels have criteria\naround impact to the organization and business.  A project that\ncreates a big splash will get people promoted.  This attracts people\nto those projects.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, maintenance does not lead well to impact.  This\nmeans that projects that aren’t shiny and new will bleed members\nfrom their teams.  Maintenance work is a dead end because in most\ncases, if you do your job right then nobody knows you’ve done\nanything at all.</p>\n<p>It’s totally understandable when you reframe it like this.\nBut nobody has to like it.</p>","excerpt":"Another Google product is being put out to pasture.
