Even with good\nintent this can be disastrous without the right context.  There’s an approach\nto this problem I found on <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190314125923/http://boz.com/articles/career-cold-start.html\">Andrew Bosworth’s site</a>.  It\nhelps you quickly gather context and build a framework to base the knowledge\naround.</p>\n<p>This approach starts with an agenda.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-agenda\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-agenda\" aria-label=\"the agenda permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Agenda</h2>\n<p>25 minutes total.  3 questions.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>20 minutes: “Tell me everything you think I should know.”</li>\n<li>3 minutes: “What are the biggest challenges the team has right now?”</li>\n<li>2 minutes: “Who else should I speak with?”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Bring a notebook, write everything down, only interrupt if you need\nclarification,and repeat this process for every name you get.  If you don’t\nknow where to start, go to your manager.</p>\n<h2 id=\"tell-me-everything-you-think-i-should-know\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#tell-me-everything-you-think-i-should-know\" aria-label=\"tell me everything you think i should know permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Tell me everything you think I should know.</h2>\n<p>This is intentionally vague.  The responses you get vary from person to person.\nJust roll with it.  Keep taking notes, and only interrupt for clarification -\nsuch as a term you don’t understand.</p>\n<p>Architecture of the build system?  Ranting about their manager?  Favorite\nrestaurant in town?  All of this is great.  Why?  Because you’re learning\nsomething new.</p>\n<p>Many people expect the universe to be efficient and orderly.  It isn’t.\nAlways assume everyone has something to teach you - even when talking about\ntopics that appear to bring no substantive value to the conversation or the\nbusiness needs.  People and organizations are messy so you’ll never know when\nsomething is relevant.</p>\n<p>You won’t learn everything you’ll need to know with your new team.  Not by a long\nshot.  Don’t fret - it’s OK.  There’s not nearly enough time for that in these\nmeetings.  Learning in depth will take you much, much longer.</p>\n<p>Instead, this exercise helps you build rapport and context.  Sometimes you’ll\nfind the location of important documentation.  Other times you’ll gather\nimportant tribal knowledge that’s not documented anywhere.  Then again, maybe\nyou’ll get a bit of a history lesson.</p>\n<p>Through this you can learn the common language of the team.  You’ll start by\nbuilding out a framework to understand where your context has gaps.  This is\nwhere all the clarification comes in.  You gain knowledge that fills in those\ngaps so you can hop over the many barriers that prevent you from joining\ndiscussions.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-biggest-challenges-the-team-has-right-now\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-are-the-biggest-challenges-the-team-has-right-now\" aria-label=\"what are the biggest challenges the team has right now permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What are the biggest challenges the team has right now?</h2>\n<p>Given the first question this could be redundant - folks will pretty frequently\nanswer it partially as what you need to know.  That’s not important, ask\nit anyway.  This question ensures that there is a focused time to understand\nthe perceived challenges that the team faces.</p>\n<p>Internalize the bigger problems - the problems that will take a long time to\nfix.  “We’re using an outdated tech stack” or “We aren’t focused on building\nthe primary product”.  Maybe they’re complex, maybe systemic, but they won’t\nbe mitigated right away.  If you’re in a  leadership role, identify how the\nteam could move toward these as long term goals.</p>\n<p>The smaller problems are often small enough that the team hasn’t prioritized\nthem.  They might be quality of life improvements, or solvable issues with\nprocess.  Things like “We’re overwhelmed with meetings” or “We have a flakey\ntest in the build that’s been frustrating”.  These are good to dig into so you\nget some quick wins while building your knowledge of the systems at play.</p>\n<p>Asynchronously follow up on these if you don’t understand them.  You don’t have\nmuch time during the meeting, and once you know of its existence you should be\nable to describe it in an email or slack message.</p>\n<h2 id=\"who-else-should-i-speak-with\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#who-else-should-i-speak-with\" aria-label=\"who else should i speak with permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Who else should I speak with?</h2>\n<p>This question is incredibly important.  Sure, it helps you fan out into the\nteam.  At the same time, though, it builds a graph of influence via the\nfrequency of names.  Forget what they shared to you the first day.  This is\nthe true org chart to guide you through social interactions.</p>\n<p>Until you’ve run out of steam I would suggest following up with every name you\nget.  I’d suggest at least talking with some of your peers and your team\nyou’ll be working with on a regular basis.  You don’t need to (or maybe can’t)\nmeet with everyone on the team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-end-goal\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-end-goal\" aria-label=\"the end goal permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The End Goal</h2>\n<p>None of this is new or too surprising.  You’re building relationships within\nyour team.  The big value here is in the asking and listening.  It shows a\nrespect to the existing team and paves the path to a level of trust.</p>\n<p>You’ll end up with more questions than answers, finding you don’t know more\nthan you thought - but at least you’ll know what you didn’t know.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/new-team-kick-start"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Team Kick Start","date":"2019/11/06","time":"05:00 UTC"}},"previous":{"id":"c3a55356-f632-5d00-baf6-5590477bc513","fields":{"slug":"/writing-javascript-behavioral-unit-tests"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Writing JavaScript Behavioral Unit Tests"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"slug":"/new-team-kick-start","postDate":"2019-11-06 00:00:00 -0500","previous":"/writing-javascript-behavioral-unit-tests","next":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
